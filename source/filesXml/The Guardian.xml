Greece is under intense pressure to table a last-chance blueprint for radical economic reform, tax increases and spending cuts on Thursday in order to secure a future in the euro and stave off financial collapse.
The reform proposals are to be sent to Greeces creditors with negotiations at the critical stage. The embattled Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras , accused his eurozone creditors on Wednesday of exploiting his country as an austerity laboratory for the past five years while formally asking Europe for three more years of rescue funds.
This is really and truly the final wakeup call for Greece but also for us, our last chance
Donald Tusk, European council president
The countdown to Greeces financial collapse shifted into its gravest phase after European leaders set Sunday as the deadline by which Tsipras has to capitulate to their menu of cuts, tax rises and fundamental reforms of the Greek economy in return for bailout money. Otherwise, EU leaders said, Greece will be cut off from the eurozone, triggering banking chaos, insolvency, and likely an exit from the single European currency.
With the five-year crisis entering a climactic five days, much will hinge on the details of the reforms that Athens is to send to the troika of bailout supervisors on Thursday. The European Central Bank , the International Monetary Fund and the European commission are to receive the details by midnight on Thursday, giving them 48 hours to examine them, negotiate, and reach a verdict before another European summit on Sunday either blesses the proposed deal or focuses on plans for coping with a new Greek currency and how to mitigate the expected post-euro humanitarian crisis in Greece.
Tsipras sounded characteristically defiant in his first big speech  to the European parliament in Strasbourg  outside Greece in almost six months in office. He declared that justice was above the law, repeated that his victory in securing a rejection of EU austerity in a snap referendum on Sunday did not mean Greeks wanted to quit the euro.
The days of treating Greece as an austerity laboratory were over, he vowed. The experiment was not a success. Poverty has soared, and so has public debt.
We have now been given a mandate to redouble our efforts in order to get a socially just and economically sustainable solution, he said. Europe will be democratic or it will have immense difficulties surviving.

On Wednesday, the head of the IMF said there can be no special treatment for Greece
Leaders of the other 18 countries in the eurozone have been angered by Tsiprass regular emphasis on democracy, arguing that they, too, are the servants of their own democratic public opinion and that if referendums were held in Germany, Finland or the Netherlands, Greece would be unceremoniously ejected from the currency rather than receiving 240bn in loans.
Athens applied for a new three-year loan agreement from the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozones permanent bailout fund. It will need at least 50bn. Optimistically, this will take more than a month to arrange and will face difficult parliamentary passages, especially in Berlin. In the short term, with Greek banks closed and fast running out of cash, ATM withdrawals limited to a daily 60, and the government unable to meet debt repayments, Athens also needs short-term bridging loans to tide it through the next few weeks. It is also demanding debt relief measures included in a new deal.
As part of broader discussions to be held, Greece welcomes an opportunity to explore potential measures to be taken so that its official sector-related debt becomes both sustainable and viable over the long term, said the bailout letter from the new finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos.
The creditors response to the Greek plea will be determined by the raft of austerity measures that Athens offers to commit to on Thursday when it is also to announce pension reforms and a VAT revamp, long some of the biggest sticking points in five months of stalemated negotiations.
The lenders terms for the new three-year rescue package, as the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, made clear in Brussels on Tuesday evening, will be even tougher than those rejected in last weekends referendum, adding to the mood of pessimism over a breakthrough.
The breakdown in trust between Tsipras and his eurozone partners is so severe that it is difficult to see how it can be rebuilt in time to salvage the situation by Sunday.
This is really and truly the final wakeup call for Greece but also for us, our last chance, said Donald Tusk, the president of the European council. Uniquely among EU leaders, Tusk blamed both sides for the looming disaster. Seek help among your friends and not among your enemies. And if you want to help your friend in need, do not humiliate him.
The collapse in confidence in the Greek authorities was evident in the response to the Tsipras speech when mainstream parliament leaders assaulted the prime minister, while the anti-EU far right, notably Marine Le Pen of Frances Front National and Nigel Farage, the UK Independence party leader, applauded the radical leftist.

The euro and austerity are Siamese twins. Your people will not escape from austerity without leaving the euro, Le Pen told Tsipras.
The strongest and most detailed contribution came from the liberals leader and former Belgian prime minister, Guy Verhofstadt. You have to come forward with your reform programme. This is not a chicken and egg discussion. It is your choice, he told the Greek leader.
How do you want to be remembered? As an electoral accident who made its people poorer? Or as a real revolutionary reformer? Show that you are a real leader and not a false prophet.

The parliament session allowed speakers to let off steam and to grandstand. It was also valuable for allowing Tsipras to make his case to a non-domestic audience in public for the first time.
But the parliament makes no decisions on Greece, is a bystander in the negotiations, and has no powers whatsoever in the debt crisis, unlike, for example, the German Bundestag which would need to endorse any new agreements with Greece.
Observers wondered why Tsipras, during such momentous and fateful days for his country, could spend almost a whole one of them in Strasbourg.

Exxon knew of climate change in 1981, email says  but it funded deniers for 27 more years
A newly unearthed missive from Lenny Bernstein, a climate expert with the oil firm for 30 years, shows concerns over high presence of carbon dioxide in enormous gas field in south-east Asia factored into decision not to tap it

ExxonMobil, the worlds biggest oil company, knew as early as 1981 of climate change  seven years before it became a public issue, according to a newly discovered email from one of the firms own scientists. Despite this the firm spent millions over the next 27 years to promote climate denial.
The email from Exxons in-house climate expert provides evidence the company was aware of the connection between fossil fuels and climate change, and the potential for carbon-cutting regulations that could hurt its bottom line, over a generation ago  factoring that knowledge into its decision about an enormous gas field in south-east Asia. The field, off the coast of Indonesia, would have been the single largest source of global warming pollution at the time.
Exxon first got interested in climate change in 1981 because it was seeking to develop the Natuna gas field off Indonesia, Lenny Bernstein, a 30-year industry veteran and Exxons former in-house climate expert, wrote in the email. This is an immense reserve of natural gas, but it is 70% CO2, or carbon dioxide, the main driver of climate change.
Related: Rockefeller family tried and failed to get ExxonMobil to accept climate change
However, Exxons public position was marked by continued refusal to acknowledge the dangers of climate change, even in response to appeals from the Rockefellers , its founding family, and its continued financial support for climate denial. Over the years, Exxon spent more than $30m on thinktanks and researchers that promoted climate denial, according to Greenpeace.
Exxon said Wednesday that it now acknowledges the risk of climate change and does not fund climate change denial groups.
Some climate campaigners have likened the industry to the conduct of the tobacco industry which for decades resisted the evidence that smoking causes cancer.
In the email Bernstein, a chemical engineer and climate expert who spent 30 years at Exxon and Mobil and was a lead author on two of the United Nations blockbuster IPCC climate science reports, said climate change first emerged on the companys radar in 1981, when the company was considering the development of south-east Asias biggest gas field, off Indonesia.
That was seven years ahead of other oil companies and the public, according to Bernsteins account.
Climate change was largely confined to the realm of science until 1988, when the climate scientist James Hansen told Congress that global warming was caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, due to the burning of fossil fuels.
By that time, it was clear that developing the Natuna site would set off a huge amount of climate change pollution  effectively a carbon bomb, according to Bernstein.
When I first learned about the project in 1989, the projections were that if Natuna were developed and its CO2 vented to the atmosphere, it would be the largest point source of CO2 in the world and account for about 1% of projected global CO2 emissions. Im sure that it would still be the largest point source of CO2, but since CO2 emissions have grown faster than projected in 1989, it would probably account for a smaller fraction of global CO2 emissions, Bernstein wrote.
The email was written in response to an inquiry on business ethics from the Institute for Applied and Professional Ethics at Ohio University.
What it shows is that Exxon knew years earlier than James Hansens testimony to Congress that climate change was a reality; that it accepted the reality, instead of denying the reality as they have done publicly, and to such an extent that it took it into account in their decision making, in making their economic calculation, the director of the Institute, Alyssa Bernstein (no relation), told the Guardian.
One thing that occurs to me is the behavior of the tobacco companies denying the connection between smoking and lung cancer for the sake of profits, but this is an order of magnitude greater moral offence, in my opinion, because what is at stake is the fate of the planet, humanity, and the future of civilisation, not to be melodramatic.
Bernsteins response, first posted on the Institutes website last October, was released by the Union of Concerned Scientists on Wednesday as part of a report on climate disinformation promoted by companies such as ExxonMobil, BP, Shell and Peabody Energy, called the Climate Deception Dossiers .
Asked about Bernsteins comments, Exxon said climate science in the early 1980s was at a preliminary stage, but the company now saw climate change as a risk.
The science in 1981 on this subject was in the very, very early days and there was considerable division of opinion
Richard Keil, Exxon spokesman
The science in 1981 on this subject was in the very, very early days and there was considerable division of opinion, Richard Keil, an Exxon spokesman, said. There was nobody you could have gone to in 1981 or 1984 who would have said whether it was real or not. Nobody could provide a definitive answer.
He rejected the idea that Exxon had funded groups promoting climate denial. I am here to talk to you about the present, he said. We have been factoring the likelihood of some kind of carbon tax into our business planning since 2007. We do not fund or support those who deny the reality of climate change.
Exxon, unlike other companies and the public at large in the early 1980s, was already aware of climate change  and the prospect of regulations to limit the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change, according to Bernsteins account.
In the 1980s, Exxon needed to understand the potential for concerns about climate change to lead to regulation that would affect Natuna and other potential projects. They were well ahead of the rest of industry in this awareness. Other companies, such as Mobil, only became aware of the issue in 1988, when it first became a political issue, he wrote.
Natural resource companies  oil, coal, minerals  have to make investments that have lifetimes of 50-100 years. Whatever their public stance, internally they make very careful assessments of the potential for regulation, including the scientific basis for those regulations, Bernstein wrote in the email.
Naomi Oreskes, a Harvard University professor who researches the history of climate science, said it was unsurprising Exxon would have factored climate change in its plans in the early 1980s  but she disputed Bernsteins suggestion that other companies were not. She also took issue with Exxons assertion of uncertainty about the science in the 1980s, noting the National Academy of Science describing a consensus on climate change from the 1970s.
The White House and the National Academy of Sciences came out with reports on climate change in the 1970s, and government scientific agencies were studying climate change in the 1960s, she said. There were also a number of major scientific meetings on climate change in the 1970s.
I find it difficult to believe that an industry whose business model depends on fossil fuels could have been completely ignoring major environmental reports, major environmental meetings taken place in which carbon dioxide and climate change were talked about, she said in an interview with the Guardian.
The East Natuna gas field, about 140 miles north-east of the Natuna islands in the South China Sea and 700 miles north of Jakarta, is the biggest in south-east Asia, with about 46tn cubic ft of recoverable reserves.
However, Exxon did not go into production on the 1.3tn cubic metre field.
Corporations are interested in environmental impacts only to the extent that they affect profits
Lenny Bernstein
Bernstein writes in his email to Ohio University: Corporations are interested in environmental impacts only to the extent that they affect profits, either current or future. They may take what appears to be altruistic positions to improve their public image, but the assumption underlying those actions is that they will increase future profits. ExxonMobil is an interesting case in point.
Bernstein, who is now in his mid-70s, spent 20 years as a scientist at Exxon and 10 years at Mobil. During the 1990s he headed the science and technology advisory committee of the Global Climate Coalition, an industry group that lobbied aggressively against the scientific consensus around the causes of climate change.
However, GCC climate experts accepted the impact of human activity on climate change in their internal communications as early as 1995, according to a document filed in a 2009 lawsuit and included in the UCS dossier.

The document, a 17-page primer on climate science produced by Bernsteins advisory committee, discounts the alternate theories about the causes of climate change promoted by climate contrarian researchers such as Willie Soon, who was partly funded by Exxon .
The contrarian theories raise interesting questions about our total understanding of climate processes, but they do not offer convincing arguments against the conventional model of greenhouse gas emission-induced climate change, the advisory committee said.
The 1995 primer was never released for publication. A subsequent version, which was publicly distributed in 1998, removed the reference to contrarian theories, and continued to dispute the science underlying climate change.
Kenneth Kimmel, the president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said ExxonMobil and the other companies profiled in its report had failed to take responsibility about the danger to the public of producing fossil fuels.
Related: US taxpayers subsidising world's biggest fossil fuel companies
Instead of taking responsibility, they have either directly  or indirectly through trade and industry groups  sown doubt about the science of climate change and fought efforts to cut emissions, he wrote in a blogpost. I believe that the conduct outlined in the UCS report puts the fossil fuel companies social license at risk. And once that social license is gone, it is very hard to get it back. Just look at what happened to tobacco companies after litigation finally pried open the documents that exposed decades of misinformation and deception.
Keil, the ExxonMobil spokesman, confirmed that the company had decided not to develop Natuna, but would not comment on the reasons. There could be a huge range of reasons why we dont develop projects, he said.
Full text of scientists email
Below is the text of an email from Lenny Bernstein to the director of the Institute for Applied and Professional Ethics at Ohio University, Alyssa Bernstein (no relation), who had asked for ideas to stimulate students for an ethics day announced by the Carnegie Council.
Alyssas right. Feel free to share this e-mail with her. Corporations are interested in environmental impacts only to the extent that they affect profits, either current or future. They may take what appears to be altruistic positions to improve their public image, but the assumption underlying those actions is that they will increase future profits. ExxonMobil is an interesting case in point.
Exxon first got interested in climate change in 1981 because it was seeking to develop the Natuna gas field off Indonesia. This is an immense reserve of natural gas, but it is 70% CO2. That CO2 would have to be separated to make the natural gas usable. Natural gas often contains CO2 and the technology for removing CO2 is well known. In 1981 (and now) the usual practice was to vent the CO2 to the atmosphere. When I first learned about the project in 1989, the projections were that if Natuna were developed and its CO2 vented to the atmosphere, it would be the largest point source of CO2 in the world and account for about 1% of projected global CO2 emissions. Im sure that it would still be the largest point source of CO2, but since CO2 emissions have grown faster than projected in 1989, it would probably account for a smaller fraction of global CO2 emissions.
The alternative to venting CO2 to the atmosphere is to inject it into ground. This technology was also well known, since the oil industry had been injecting limited quantities of CO2 to enhance oil recovery. There were many questions about whether the CO2 would remain in the ground, some of which have been answered by Statoils now almost 20 years of experience injecting CO2 in the North Sea. Statoil did this because the Norwegian government placed a tax on vented CO2. It was cheaper for Statoil to inject CO2 than pay the tax. Of course, Statoil has touted how much CO2 it has prevented from being emitted.
In the 1980s, Exxon needed to understand the potential for concerns about climate change to lead to regulation that would affect Natuna and other potential projects. They were well ahead of the rest of industry in this awareness. Other companies, such as Mobil, only became aware of the issue in 1988, when it first became a political issue. Natural resource companies  oil, coal, minerals  have to make investments that have lifetimes of 50-100 years. Whatever their public stance, internally they make very careful assessments of the potential for regulation, including the scientific basis for those regulations. Exxon NEVER denied the potential for humans to impact the climate system. It did question  legitimately, in my opinion  the validity of some of the science.
Political battles need to personify the enemy. This is why liberals spend so much time vilifying the Koch brothers  who are hardly the only big money supporters of conservative ideas. In climate change, the first villain was a man named Donald Pearlman, who was a lobbyist for Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. (In another life, he was instrumental in getting the US Holocaust Museum funded and built.) Pearlmans usefulness as a villain ended when he died of lung cancer  he was a heavy smoker to the end.
Then the villain was the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a trade organization of energy producers and large energy users. I was involved in GCC for a while, unsuccessfully trying to get them to recognize scientific reality. (That effort got me on to the front page of the New York Times, but thats another story.) Environmental group pressure was successful in putting GCC out of business, but they also lost their villain. They needed one which wouldnt die and wouldnt go out of business. Exxon, and after its merger with Mobil ExxonMobil, fit the bill, especially under its former CEO, Lee Raymond, who was vocally opposed to climate change regulation. ExxonMobils current CEO, Rex Tillerson, has taken a much softer line, but ExxonMobil has not lost its position as the personification of corporate, and especially climate change, evil. It is the only company mentioned in Alyssas e-mail, even though, in my opinion, it is far more ethical that many other large corporations.
Having spent twenty years working for Exxon and ten working for Mobil, I know that much of that ethical behavior comes from a business calculation that it is cheaper in the long run to be ethical than unethical. Safety is the clearest example of this. ExxonMobil knows all too well the cost of poor safety practices. The Exxon Valdez is the most public, but far from the only, example of the high cost of unsafe operations. The value of good environmental practices are more subtle, but a facility that does a good job of controlling emission and waste is a well run facility, that is probably maximizing profit. All major companies will tell you that they are trying to minimize their internal CO2 emissions. Mostly, they are doing this by improving energy efficiency and reducing cost. The same is true for internal recycling, again a practice most companies follow. Its [sic] just good engineering.
I could go on, but this e-mail is long enough.

The US National Security Agency tapped phone calls involving German chancellor Angela Merkel and her closest advisers for years and spied on the staff of her predecessors, according to WikiLeaks.
A report released by the group on Wednesday suggested NSA spying on Merkel and her staff had gone on far longer and more widely than previously realised. WikiLeaks said the NSA targeted 125 phone numbers of top German officials for long-term surveillance .
The release risks renewing tensions between Germany and the US a month after they sought to put a row over spying behind them, with Barack Obama declaring in Bavaria that the two nations were inseparable allies.
WikiLeaks published what it said were three NSA intercepts of Merkels conversations, and data it said listed telephone numbers for the chancellor, her aides, her office and even her fax machine.
The names associated with some of the targets indicate that spying on the Chancellery predates Angela Merkel as it includes staff of former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder (in office 1998-2002), and his predecessor Helmut Kohl, WikiLeaks added in a statement.
No comment was immediately available from the German government.
The intercepts released on Wednesday detailed communications from Merkel in 2009 regarding the international financial crisis, with the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates in 2009 on Iran, and with advisers in 2011 on the eurozone crisis.
The targeted phone numbers included those for the phones of senior officials at the Chancellery and included that of Ronald Pofalla, Merkels former chief of staff, WikiLeaks said.
Related: Merkel compared NSA to Stasi in heated encounter with Obama
Spying is a sensitive issue in Germany because of abuses committed during the Nazi and Communist eras. Revelations by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden about wide-ranging US espionage in Germany caused outrage when they surfaced.
The spying row has also been stirred by allegations that Merkels staff gave the German BND foreign intelligence agency a green light to help the NSA spy on European firms and officials.
The latest WikiLeaks release comes just over a week after it published a report showing the NSA wiretapped the communications of two successive French finance ministers and collected information on French export contracts, trade and budget talks.

New York stock exchange reopens after 'technical issue' forced shutdown
Stocks worth $28tn total were suspended for three and a half hours Wednesday, as authorities report glitch was not due to cyber terrorism or criminal activity
An options trader talks to a reporter about the New York stock exchange shutdown on Wednesday. Some traders were told the shutdown was due to an overnight software update.

The New York stock exchange reopened on Wednesday afternoon after a more than three-and-a-half-hour shutdown caused by a still unexplained internal technical issue.
Trading restarted at 3.10pm local time after all NYSE-listed stocks, worth a combined $28tn, were suspended at 11.32am because of technical problem which the authorities said was not a cyber-attack or the result of criminal activity.

The suspension is just one of seven NYSE closures since the founding of a predecessor exchange in 1817. The other closures were due to major world events, including the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln in 1865, the September 11 attacks in 2001 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012.
Tom Farley, president of NYSE, admitted that its not a good day, but still failed to explain what caused the problem beyond ruling out a cyber-attack. The outage was caused by a configuration problem in our system that needed fixing, Farley told CNBC.
We found what was wrong and we fixed what was wrong and we have no evidence whatsoever to suspect that it was external, he said. Tonight and overnight starts the investigation of what exactly we need to change. Do we need to change those protocols? Absolutely. Exactly what those changes are Im not prepared to say.
President Barack Obama had been briefed on the situation by Department of Homeland Security, which ruled out a cyber terrorism attack, the prospect of which has long worried politicians, regulators and traders. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said there was no indication that malicious actors were involved.
The FBI said there were no signs of suspicious activity and no law enforcement action was needed, but the NYSE had as of Wednesday night still not explained the cause of the shutdown.
Were currently experiencing a technical issue that were working to resolve as quickly as possible, a NYSE spokesman said. We are doing our utmost to produce a swift resolution, communicate thoroughly and transparently, and ensure a timely and orderly market re-open.
The NYSE updated traders about the halt in a series of tweets . The issue we are experiencing is an internal technical issue and is not the result of a cyber breach, the Twitter feed said. We chose to suspend trading on NYSE to avoid problems arising from our technical issue. NYSE-listed securities continue to trade unaffected on other market centers.
Mary Jo White, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said the regulator was in contact with NYSE and are closely monitoring the situation and trading in NYSE-listed stocks.
Traders at the exchange said they had been told the problem was caused by an overnight software update. They told us they did some software updates overnight and tested it without problems, but this morning something happened, Peter Costa, president of Empire Executions, told the Wall Street Journal.
Costa, a floor trader, said NYSE executives had promised that trading would soon be restored. The exchange did not respond to requests for comment on the source of the technical problem.
Rich Barry, the floor governor of the NYSE, said: We have our best and smartest on the issue and hope that it is resolved ASAP.
As trading reopened at 3.10pm, later than a previously planned restart at 2.45pm, the NYSE tweeted: Trading on NYSE and NYSE MKT has resumed. All the major indices dipped when trading resumed, but had already been lower before the suspension in trading.
The stock market shutdown came just hours after United Airlines was forced to ground all of its US flights following a separate technical glitch it described as a automation issues. The airline, which has 4,935 daily departures, halted all flights for more than an hour on Wednesday morning. The Wall Street Journals website also went down due to a technical issue at the same time as the NYSE suspended trading.
The NYSE glitch came as Chinas stock markets continued to free-fall and with the Greek debt crisis still rattling European investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 213 points when trading was halted, a fall of 1.2%.
Chinas stock markets, which lost 6% on Wednesday, have fallen more than 30% in the past three weeks after soaring 150% in the past year. Chinas regulators have blamed irrational selling and panic sentiment. The FTSE 100, which closed as normal just before the NYSE glitch occurred, closed up 0.9% to 6,491.

Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank, said he initially worried that Chinas woes had spread to the US when he heard the news and was relieved that it appeared to be a technical glitch. That said, it doesnt add a lot of confidence in the markets when investors dont have a lot to begin with, he said.
At about 1pm  an hour and a half after the trading halted  one NYSEs trader walked over to the barricades outside the exchanges Wall Street headquarters. As he strolled over reporters flocked to him. What? Do you want my autograph now? he asked. I cant comment. Whats scary is you asking me all these questions.
Rumours that the NYSE shutdown may have been caused by a possible cyber-attack were heightened by a tweet from hacking group Anonymous. Wonder if tomorrow is going to be bad for Wall Street  We can only hope, said a tweet posted from one of its main Twitter accounts early on Wednesday morning .

Tunisia fears more potentially destabilising terrorist attacks such as the one that killed 38 foreign tourists last month, which is why it has imposed a state of emergency, the premier said on Wednesday.
Eight days after the 26 June shootings at the Mediterranean resort of Port El Kantaoui, president Beji Caid Essebsi decreed a state of emergency on Saturday for 30 days.
The rampage by a Tunisian student killed 30 Britons, three Irish nationals, two Germans, one Belgian, one Portuguese and a Russian, and was claimed by the Islamic State group.
We are engaged in a ferocious war against terrorism to protect lives and property, defend the republican regime  the civil state and its institutions, prime minister Habib Essid told parliament.
We would not have felt obliged to decree the state of emergency if we were not convinced that our country was facing numerous terrorist plans to destabilise the country.
He spoke of the gangs of terrorism, murder and crime preparing other operations  aimed at killing the maximum number of people, undermining morale and grinding the national economy to a halt.
Essid spoke as human rights groups warned the state of emergency should not suppress freedoms gained since the 2011 revolution that overthrew longtime dictator Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali .
But while saying whatever it takes, we will prevail over terrorism, this would not come at the expense of human rights, which will not be touched, Essid said.
Meanwhile, Tunisia will complete construction of a barrier along the Libyan border, from Ras Jedir on the Mediterranean coast to Dhiba, 186 kilometres (115 miles) to the southwest, a defence ministry official said.
The barrier, which will include berms and trenches, was announced after a terrorist attack on the national museum in Tunis in March killed 22 people, mostly tourists.
Work began on the barrier in April and will be completed by the end of the year, Belhassan Oueslati said.
The interior ministry said on Wednesday that 33 young Tunisians, mostly Islamic fundamentalists, have gone missing, with media saying that their families fear they have joined extremist groups in Libya.
Members of the group, which includes one woman, are aged between 16 and 35, it said, adding that their families reported them missing from the southern province of Tataouine.
The perpetrators of both the beach and museum attacks were said to have been trained in Libya .
The state of emergency grants the security forces exceptional powers. Among them, it allows the authorities to bar strike action and public meetings deemed dangerous to public order and to increase controls on the media.
The current state of emergency is not the first to be imposed in Tunisia since the revolution that sparked the Arab spring.

A court in Naples has sentenced former Italian premier and media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi to three years in prison for bribing a senator as part of a plot to destabilise a 2006-08 centre-left government.
Berlusconi, 78, will not have to serve the sentence as the statute of limitations expires later this year, well before a final ruling will have been reached on appeal.
It was a good trial, passionate, but in terms of consequences the imminent expiration date takes all the pathos out of the verdict, said prosecutor Henry John Woodcock after the sentence was delivered on Wednesday.
The case centred around bribes totalling 3m (2.16m) that were paid, through an intermediary, to Sergio De Gregorio, who admits accepting the money, in order to get him to leave the coalition of then premier Romano Prodi.

The bribe was part of a plan to further weaken a fragile coalition and the defection was widely seen as hurting Prodis government, which collapsed in 2008, two years after the election. Berlusconis centre-right Forza Italia party won the resulting election and he served a third term as Italian premier until 2011.
The case marks the latest in a string of legal troubles for Berlusconi.
Earlier this year, he completed a community service order for corporate tax fraud but was cleared of having sex with an under-age dancer after judges ruled he could not have known she was a minor.
Berlusconi would have gone to prison for the tax fraud had he been younger but was allowed to serve his time by helping out once a week with dementia sufferers at an old peoples home.
In summing up the bribery case, prosecutor Vincenzo Piscitelli had told the court the 3m paid to the senator were a colossal economic investment made with the aim of achieving the sole goal that interested Berlusconi, who was obsessed by his desire to kick Prodi out and take his post.
The case will reach its statute of limitations in October or November at the latest, according to Italian media.

The wife of one of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists murdered during the Paris terror attacks earlier this year is bringing legal action to identify failings in the security response.
Maryse Wolinski, whose husband Georges was one of those killed when two gunmen attacked the magazines offices in January, has reportedly started civil proceedings in France that will give her access to police files.
She told the French radio station RTL that she believed the police response was inadequate and she wanted to know the truth about how her husband died.
She is asking a judge to order an investigation into the response of the police, an inquiry that would not otherwise be carried out as a matter of course. The claim could lead to a criminal investigation into any failings identified.
Related: Charlie Hebdo: could security services have prevented Paris attacks?
Wolinski, a 72-year-old journalist, told RTL she wanted to understand the circumstances surrounding the attack, including the security arrangements.
Im not angry with those who are left behind, I am angry in general about what has happened. Were there failings? Yes, of course. Why was there no [police] van? Why did the GIGN (an elite armed police unit) not turn up?
There were numerous phone calls from different people in the building before the [gunmen] arrived at the editorial office. Therefore, one wonders why it was three officers on bicycles who arrived when the reports were of two armed men wearing hoods and masks, she said.
She said she would examine the police investigation files, which should be released to her within days, with her lawyer before deciding how to proceed.
A spokesman for the French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, did not respond to a request for comment. The French prime minister, Manuel Valls, said he understood that the victims families had questions, adding that it was their right to know the truth.

FBI chief wants 'backdoor access' to encrypted communications to fight Isis
Experts warn that magical thinking of a security flaw only the US government could exploit could easily be utilized by hackers, foreign spies and terrorists

The director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation has warned US senators that the threat from the Islamic State merits a debate about limiting commercial encryption  the linchpin of digital security  despite a growing chorus of technical experts who say that undermining encryption would prove an enormous boon for hackers, cybercriminals, foreign spies and terrorists.
In a twin pair of appearances before the Senates judiciary and intelligence committees on Wednesday, James Comey testified that Isiss use of end-to-end encryption , whereby the messaging service being used to send information does not have access to the decryption keys of those who receive it, helped the group place a devil on the shoulders of potential recruits saying kill, kill, kill, kill.
Comey said that while the FBI is thus far disrupting Isis plots, I cannot see me stopping these indefinitely. He added: I am not trying to scare folks.
Since October, following Apples decision to bolster its mobile-device security, Comey has called for a debate about inserting back doors  or front doors, as he prefers to call them  into encryption software, warning that  encryption threatens to lead us all to a very, very dark place .
But Comey and deputy attorney general Sally Quillian Yates testified that they do not at the moment envision proposing legislation to mandate surreptitious or backdoor access to law enforcement. Both said they did not wish the government to itself hold user encryption keys and preferred to engage communications providers for access, though technicians have stated that what Comey and Yates seek is fundamentally incompatible with end-to-end encryption.
Comey, who is not a software engineer, said his response to that was: Really? He framed himself as an advocate of commercial encryption to protect personal data who believed that the finest minds of Silicon Valley can invent new modes of encryption that can work for US law enforcement and intelligence agencies without inevitably introducing security flaws.
While the FBI director did not specifically cite which encrypted messaging apps Isis uses, the Guardian reported in December that its grand mufti used WhatsApp to communicate with his former mentor. WhatsApp adopted end-to-end encryption last year.
I think we need to provide a court-ordered process for obtaining that data, said Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat and former intelligence committee chair who represents Silicon Valley.
But Comeys campaign against encryption has run into a wall of opposition from digital security experts and engineers. Their response is that there is no technical way to insert a back door into security systems for governments that does not leave the door ajar for anyone  hackers, criminals, foreign intelligence services  to exploit and gain access to enormous treasure troves of user data, including medical records, financial information and much more.
The cybersecurity expert Susan Landau, writing on the prominent blog Lawfare, called Comeys vision of a security flaw only the US government could exploit  magical thinking .
Comey is aided in his fight against encryption by two allies, one natural and the other accidental. The natural ally is the National Security Agency director, Michael Rogers, who in February sparred with Yahoos chief of information security when the Yahoo official likened the anti-crypto push to  drilling a hole in the windshield , saying: I just believe that this is achievable. Well have to work our way through it. The Guardian, thanks to Edward Snowdens disclosures, revealed in September 2013 that the NSA already undermines encryption .
The less obvious ally is China, whom the FBI blamed last month for stealing a massive hoard of federal personnel data.
In May, China unveiled a national security law calling for  secure and controllable  technologies, something US and foreign companies fear is a prelude to a demand for backdoor entry into companies encryption software or outright provision of encryption keys.
Without ever mentioning his own FBI directors and NSA directors similar demands, Barack Obama castigated Chinas anti-encryption push in March. Obama has also declined to criticize efforts in the UK, the USs premier foreign ally, to undermine encryption. Prime minister David Cameron is proposing to introduce legislation in the autumn to force companies such as Apple, Google and Microsoft to provide access to encrypted data.
Under questioning from some skeptical senators, Comey made a number of concessions. When Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, asked if foreign countries would attempt to mandate similar access, Comey replied, I think they might. The director acknowledged that foreign companies, exempt from any hypothetical US mandate, would be free to market encryption software.
In advance of Comeys testimony, several of the worlds leading cryptographers, alarmed by the return of a battle they thought won during the 1990s Crypto Wars, rejected the effort as pernicious from a security perspective and technologically illiterate .
A paper they released on Tuesday, called Keys Under Doormats, said the transatlantic effort to insert backdoors into encryption was unworkable in practice, raise[s] enormous legal and ethical questions, and would undo progress on security at a time when internet vulnerabilities are causing extreme economic harm.
Asked by Feinstein if the experts had a point, Comey said: Maybe. If thats the case, I guess were stuck.
Kevin Bankston of the New America Foundation called into question the necessity of Comeys warnings that encryption would lead to law enforcement going dark against threats. Bankston, in a Tuesday blogpost, noted that the governments latest wiretap disclosure found that state and federal governments could not access four encrypted conversations out of 3,554 wiretapped in 2014 .
Yet Yates said both that the Justice Department was increasingly facing the encryption challenge and that she lacked the data quantifying how serious the challenge was. Yates told the Senate judiciary committee that law enforcement declined to seek warrants in cases of encrypted communications and did not say how often it made such a decision.

        <title>Greek island refugee crisis: local people and tourists rally round migrants</title>

On the northern coast of Lesbos, on the shore outside a famous local hotel, the footfall is usually limited to tourists. But this morning, there is an unusual interloper. Its the president of the local village, Thanassis Andreotis, who stands on the back of his white pick-up and tugs the remains of a huge inflatable dinghy up from the beach below. Every morning now, refugees use dinghies like this one to get from the Turkish shore  six miles away in the distance  to the Greek islands. And Andreotis sees it as his human duty to pick up the debris.
Related: Greece sees huge increase in migrants arriving by boat
Its way, way, way more than last year, says Andreotis, a retired policeman. Last year Id be doing this once a week. Now its once a day.
There have long been refugees trying their luck in these waters. But this year, amid the worlds biggest wave of mass-migration since the second world war, the numbers arriving on this isolated shoreline have reached record levels. Arrivals to the Greek archipelago are already 50% higher than for the whole of 2014  and have even now out-paced Italy. Lesbos, hitherto known as an exquisite tourist destination, has become the frontline  the Greek Lampedusa .
It could not have happened at a worse time. The Greek economy is close to collapse, with the European Central Bank threatening on Wednesday to withdraw its support for Greek banks by the end of the week.
Not that Andreotis blames the refugees. Theyre hunted by their government and theyre running everywhere from horrible things, he says, hauling the last bits of dinghy up from the beach. And he says that lots of local people  some of whom are themselves descendants of migrants who left Turkey in 1922  agree with him. When he recently went into the centre of town with a megaphone and called for donations for the migrants, within 10 minutes there were four cars of supplies.
Related: Migrant boat crisis: the story of the Greek hero on the beach
With the central government unable to properly provide for many of its citizens, let alone migrants, this is how the humanitarian vacuum has often been filled.
Western reporting has centred on how the wave of migrants, sharing beaches with wealthy holidaymakers, have incensed foreigners and residents alike. There is certainly an awkward juxtaposition: further round this Lesbos beach, tourists sunbathe metres from an Angry Birds arm-band left on the beach by an infant migrant.
But there is also another story  one of locals, tourists and expats doing their best in tough circumstances to provide as warm a welcome as possible for a less fortunate kind of expatriate.

One of the first welcomes is provided by a British couple, Eric and Philippa Kempson, who live just metres from the closest beaches to Turkey. An eccentric long-haired artist who doesnt own a mobile, Eric Kempson is an unexpected connoisseur of Aegean smuggling networks. Originally from Windsor, hes lived here on the north coast of Lesbos for 16 years, earning his living by carving boutique wooden jewellery and sculptures .
Related: The Journey: A refugee's odyssey from Syria to Sweden
But over the past few months Kempson has developed a new specialism. Hes learned to spot the migrant dinghies from the moment they leave Turkey at dawn. Early each morning, he and his wife rush up and down the Greek shoreline, handing out water, dry clothes and food to the most vulnerable arrivals.
Usually there are two black boats that come out, mainly Afghans, Pakistanis, mostly men, says Kempson. About an hour later, we normally get three grey boats full of Syrians, and those are the ones we usually focus on because theyre full of women and children.
It has been an upsetting experience, he says. When you see two-week-old children, people with cut feet, and people who havent eaten for days  you cant do anything. I hadnt cried in 20 years, and I am a hard bastard. But Ive cried so much in the last four months.
In logistical terms, the Greek government cannot cope either. The EU now wants to establish so-called quarantine zones for migrants on the Greek islands  but the government here already lacks the capacity to house the current wave of arrivals.
So in the south of the island, local activists have taken things into their own hands, turning an old scout camp into a makeshift, volunteer-run migrant reception centre called the Village of Altogether.

Driving migrants here from the beaches is a legal grey area. Under Greek law, you could be accused of the crime of people-smuggling. But on the other hand, says a defiant Efi Latsoudis, one of the camps founders, we cannot stay watching hundreds of people with their children  walking, lying in the streets  and let them die there under the sun. Its impossible. Thats also a crime, to let someone die in the street.
In the north of the island, in the village of Molyvos, others have followed suit. An Australian whos lived here for four decades, Melinda McRostie, has turned a slip of land behind her well-known quayside restaurant into a makeshift migrant campsite. As soon as Kempson sends her the days headcount, her kitchen team at The Captains Table get to work preparing food for the islands newest guests, largely using food and supplies donated by tourists and locals.
Its obvious that its not something thats going to stop, says McRostie, of the wave of arrivals that have landed on Lesbos in recent weeks. So the only obvious thing to do is to do something about it.
McRostie can fit up to 180 people on the land behind her restaurant. This day, there are just 51 Afghanis and a single Pakistani here, sleeping off their exhaustion under the shade of a tarpaulin. Each of them lost all their remaining belongings earlier in the morning, after their boat started sinking a kilometre from Greece . Only quick work by the Hellenic coastguard saved their lives.
Suddenly there was water coming on the boat, and the engine stopped, remembers Tawfiq Amini, a former mechanic for the US army in Afghanistan, who fled home after the Taliban threatened him for working with foreigners. Everyone was shouting, the women were screaming. Everyone threw their bags in the water because we thought the boat was too heavy.

Doing her best for people like Amini every day, McRostie finds it emotionally tough. Ive stopped remembering names, she says, carrying two trays of sandwiches from her storeroom to the camp. Ive stopped asking stories. Its just too hard.
But there are some on Lesbos who never wanted to listen in the first place. Get them away from here, shouts another local restauranteur, pointing at the makeshift camp that backs on to his property. Hes worried it will put off customers.
The same day, a vicious rumour circulates via social media that Muslim migrants have defecated in churches, and defiled their icons. It turns out to be a lie, but the takeaway is clear: there are those on the islands far right who want to stir up resentment of migrants. Golden Dawn, Greeces far-right party, is certainly quick to seize its chance. We will do everything we can to protect the Greek homeland against immigrants, the party says in response to the defecation story.
The abuse has sometimes got personal. Kempson says he receives threats because of his activism. During a conversation with the Guardian, an anonymous caller rings his house phone and breathes silently on the other end of the line. No matter where you are in the world, youll get these threats, he says. Youll have people with black hearts who hate human beings.
We cannot stay watching hundreds of people with their children and let them die there under the sun
Andreotis says its a challenge to keep people united. There are people who think this will impact tourism, he says, the dinghy now safely squeezed into his pick-up. But by and large weve managed to make sure that people dont think theres anything to be afraid of.
One thing that does worry people is the risk of prosecution should they help a migrant. In order to apply for papers to leave for the mainland, migrants need to get to the islands capital, Mytilene, 40 miles to the south.
But if they land on the island without being rescued by coastguards, they cant legally be driven there. Due to the law that equates assisting migrants with the act of people-smuggling, public buses wont let them board, and locals have been threatened with 100 (71) fines if they give anyone a lift. Two have even been arrested.
Kempson has been explicitly warned by the police against driving anyone into town, and has also stopped helping people on the beaches themselves, lest he be accused of smuggling. The result is that most migrants, in order to embark on the next stage of their journey to mainland Europe , have to walk 40 miles in the heat.
In the main bus stop at the edge of Molyvos, a group of Syrian Kurds who fled the advance of Islamic State 10 days ago are bracing themselves for the trek. Theyre weighing up whether to walk  or to plea for local officials to make an exception. Us men can walk it, but not the women and children, says a 40-year-old, who calls himself Abu Azab. Theres two pregnant women with us. Did we really risk death at sea for this?
But even in the face of censure, many locals are doing their best to help under the radar  and even in full view. A few days ago, 41 drivers organised a convoy from Molyvos to Mytilene, each car carrying migrants in full violation of the law. The police did not dare arrest anyone.

Tourists are also at it in their hire cars. Miel Lammens, a Belgian lab technician on holiday in Lesbos for the second time, has driven three groups of migrants southwards, under his own steam. He drops them a short way from built-up areas, to avoid being detected. In the beginning I was worried  I thought, should I do this or not? Lammens says. But when you pass them and see the women and children, you think, yes, I should. I must do something. It costs me nothing.
Lammens also scoffs at the idea that migrants have ruined anyones holidays. The island has not changed because there are refugees, he says. Tourists can still lie on the beach without any problem. I havent seen any refugees begging. Theres no problem. If you go to Rome, people are begging for money. But here you dont have that. I have no idea why youd cancel your vacation.
There are even some who have devoted their holidays to helping the migrants. One couple flew in specifically to assist the Kempsons in their daily mission. Sabine Fischer, a German nurse, hadnt heard of the refugee influx before arriving on the island for a holiday but decided to help once she saw the situation. So every morning for a fortnight, she has helped McRostie prepare food and talk to the migrants. Somehow it just developed, says Fischer. They needed someone to help in the morning. I think: Im here, I dont have to do any work, I can help.
And McRostie hopes more people follow in Fischers wake  not necessarily to help at the camp, but simply to maintain the local economy. Greece already has one crisis, and now were having another one, says McRostie. We need tourists to support us.

Microsoft announced on Wednesday that it is cutting 7,800 jobs and taking a loss of $7.6bn on its money-losing mobile phone business.
The cuts add to the roughly 12,500 jobs eliminated in the past year from the Nokia phone business that Microsoft bought for $7.3bn in 2012. Some 2,300 of the jobs will be made in Finland, where Nokia is headquartered .
Related: What does Microsoft's $7.6bn, 7,800-person layoff mean for Windows Phone?
In a statement, chief executive Satya Nadella said Microsoft was reassessing its smartphone strategy, though he gave no specific details. We are moving from a strategy to grow a standalone phone business to a strategy to grow and create a vibrant Windows ecosystem including our first-party device family, said Nadella. In the near term, well run a more effective and focused phone portfolio business while retaining capability for long-term reinvention in mobility.
Microsofts former CEO Steve Ballmer bought Finlands Nokia as its Windows Phone system has struggled to compete against Apples iPhone and Googles Android system. But the purchase has failed to attract new users and Windows Phone still accounts for less than 5% of the market for mobile operating systems.
After taking into account restructuring charges the company has now written off more than the entire cost of buying Nokia.
The company is in the midst of a broader restructuring that includes cutting 18,000 jobs. Microsoft is expected to give more details when it reports earnings on 21 July.

Hillary Clinton has been accused of lying about receiving a subpoena from the House select committee on Benghazi by the committees chair, in a heated back-and-forth that has renewed tensions over the presidential frontrunners use of private email.
In a statement on Wednesday, Republican congressman Trey Gowdy accused the former secretary of state of making an inaccurate claim during an interview on Tuesday. Responding to a question about the controversy surrounding her email server while at the US state department, Clinton had told CNN: Ive never had a subpoena.
Related: Hillary Clinton defends her trustworthiness in CNN interview
But Gowdy said: The committee has issued several subpoenas, but I have not sought to make them public. I would not make this one public now, but after Secretary Clinton falsely claimed the committee did not subpoena her, I have no choice in order to correct the inaccuracy.
Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told the Guardian that Gowdys accusation itself was inaccurate, insisting that the congressman had not issued a subpoena until March.
She was asked about her decision to not to retain her personal emails after providing all those that were work-related, and the suggestion was made that a subpoena was pending at that time. That was not accurate, Merrill wrote in an email.
Gowdy also posted a copy of the subpoena on the Benghazi committees website.
According to Gowdy, the committee immediately subpoenaed Clinton personally after learning the full extent of her unusual email arrangement with herself, and would have done so earlier if the State Department or Clinton had been forthcoming that State did not maintain custody of her records and only Secretary Clinton herself had her records when Congress first requested them.
Although originally set up by Congress to investigate the response to the 11 September 2012 attack on the US consulate at Benghazi, the committees remit has since expanded to probe the controversy around Clintons use of a personal email address while serving as secretary of state.
In her CNN interview, Clinton insisted that the issue was being blown up with no basis in law or in fact that she went above and beyond her legal obligations in cooperating with the committee.
Merrill, the Clinton spokesman, pushed that line further on Wednesday: The subpoena asked for documents pertaining to Libya and the attacks on our facility in Benghazi, he told the Guardian. He said Clinton had already handed over those documents, along with tens of thousands of others.

Baltimore police commissioner Anthony Batts has been fired by the citys mayor, in a shock announcement made amid a sharply increased murder rate and scathing criticism of his handling of civil unrest earlier this year.
Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said on Wednesday afternoon that she had decided to replace Batts, who has led the police department for almost three years. Deputy commissioner Kevin Davis is to take over as interim commissioner, she said.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Rawlings-Blake said she made the decision in an attempt to reverse a crime surge being suffered by the city. Families are tired of feeling this pain, and so am I, she said.
We need a change, said the mayor. This was not an easy decision, but it is one that is in the best interests of the people of Baltimore. The people of Baltimore deserve better.
Batts, 54, had been under increasing pressure to tackle a spike in violent crime. So far in 2015 the city has sustained a 48% rise in homicides and 86% rise in shootings compared with the same period last year.
The mayors statement came just hours after a sharply critical police union report that lambasted Battss management of the department during riots and protests that broke out in the city following the death of Freddie Gray in April .
Calls for Battss resignation had been mounting from members of the city council and Baltimoreans United in Leadership Development (BUILD), a coalition of local religious leaders.
Rev Andrew Foster Connors, a co-chairman of BUILD, said on Wednesday the firing of Batts should allow the city to install a new leader who can quiet the streets and begin to rebuild the relationship between police and the people they serve.
He was a leader who lost his following, Foster Connors said in a text message. Its not a celebratory day but its the right decision for the city. We need leadership who can command both the respect of the community and the respect of his officers. Mr Batts lost both.
Earlier on Wednesday, Baltimores Fraternal Order of Police Lodge Three cited evidence that Batts directly instructed officers to refrain from arresting rioters involved in looting in the city and placed much of the blame for the citys descent into civil unrest at the hands of Batts.
Gray, 25, died after sustaining severe spinal injuries in police custody on 12 April. The city erupted in protests following his death before descending into riots that attracted international attention and raised serious questions over the city polices treatment of African American residents, and brought racial disparities in the city to the fore.
Six police officers involved with Grays arrest have been criminally charged over his death. The driver of a police van in which Gray suffered a broken neck is charged with murder. All six have pleaded not guilty.
Baltimore City states attorney Marilyn Mosby, whose office will prosecute the Gray case, said in a statement on Wednesday she had already met with interim commissioner Davis and praised Batts for his service to the city of Baltimore.
Activist leaders said after the announcement they were skeptical that the change would have significant consequences. Removing Commissioner Batts at this point will give the Baltimore Police a chance to claim theyre starting over without actually changing, DeRay Mckesson, a prominent protester and Baltimore native, said on Twitter.

A Russian foundation that gave grants to young scientists and mathematicians has been forced to close down after it was branded a foreign agent, under a controversial Kremlin law.
In a one-line statement on its website the Dynasty Foundation in Moscow announced on Monday that it was liquidating all of its activities. The foundation had been operating since 2002 and had sponsored numerous scientific grants and prizes.
Its 82-year-old founder Dmitry Zimin  a successful entrepreneur and philanthropist who founded Beeline, one of Russias biggest mobile networks  left the country last month and is now in exile abroad, according to media reports in Russia.
The foundation is the latest victim of a 2012 law, which requires all non-governmental organisations that receive western funding to register as foreign agents  a term that implies the organisations are involved in spying.
Russias justice ministry says the non-profit foundation falls under the definition because Zimins bank accounts, which support Dynasty, are kept abroad. Zimins supporters point out that his fortune is entirely self-made.
They add that the money - $8m (5.2m) this year - has been used for patriotic purposes and for the benefit of Russian science, following years of degradation, brain drain and budget cuts.

The ministry later broadened its attack by pointing to Dynastys funding of Liberal Mission, an organisation run by the former economy minister Yevgeny Yasin, which aims to spread liberal values in Russia. Yasin said that Zimin had now quit Russia for an indefinite period .
The decision to close the foundation was made on Monday. It follows an emotional meeting by the board last month which decided to explore alternative sources of funding, with a view to carrying on.
Scientists have reacted angrily to the assault on Dynasty . More than 3,000 researchers, writers, publishers, and students have signed an open letter calling on the justice ministry to reverse the decision, which they called not an ordinary example of mindless bureaucratic zeal but a direct blow to the pride, prestige, fame, and future of the country.
Separately on Wednesday, Russias upper chamber called on authorities to blacklist 12 foreign NGOs  including US-based Freedom House, the National Endowment for Democracy, and the Ukrainian World Congress  as undesirable.

Chinas stock exchange regulator has imposed severe limits on stock market selling, having earlier warned of panic in the market as a range of recent government measures failed to prevent stocks plummeting a further 6%.
After 10 minutes of morning trading a wave of listed companies shares had been suspended across Chinas two stock markets after they dropped by the daily limit of 10%.
Related: Why is China's stock market in crisis?
The China Securities Regulatory Commission ruled that controlling shareholders and managers holding more than 5% of a companys shares could not reduce their holdings for six months, in an attempt to maintain stability in the markets.
Earlier, the regulators statement saying there had been a surge in irrational selling and panic sentiment had done little to calm investor nerves.
The Shanghai composite index closed down 5.9%, while the SCI 300 index of the biggest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen lost 6.8%.
The rout spread to other world stock markets, with Hong Kongs Hang Seng index closing almost 6% down, its biggest one-day drop for nearly seven years.
Since their June peak, Shanghai stocks have plunged 30% in the space of three weeks, having soared more than 150% in the previous 12 months as millions of -private investors piled in. Its a stampede, said Wang Feng, a former Wall Street trader who founded the hedge fund firm Alpha Squared Capital. And the problem of the market is that all the players move in the same direction and are too emotional.

About 1,400 companies, or more than half of those listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen  filed for a trading halt on Tuesday in an attempt to prevent further losses. Chen Jiahe, chief strategic analyst at Cinda Securities, said this suspension was likely to last until the market was stabilised and liquidity was returned to the market.
Christopher Balding, professor of economics at Peking University, said it was not possible to know exactly why so many companies had suspended trading, but that a large number were doing so because they had used their own stock as collateral for loans and wanted to lock in the value for the collateral.
Unlike most other stock markets, where most investors are institutional, in China 80% are small retail investors. Balding said this was raising concerns of political risk in Beijing. With large numbers of private investors losing a lot of money, the government would be worried about people protesting on the streets.
As part of the attempt to prevent further losses, Chinas state asset regulator had already ordered state-owned enterprises not to sell shares of their listed companies.
The Peoples Bank of China said it was assisting the China Securities Finance Corporation (CSFC), the national margin trading service provider  which helps brokers lend money to institutions to buy shares  to help steady the market.
It said it would do this through measures such as aiding interbank lending. It would keep a close watch on the market, continue to support the CSFC and guard against systematic and financial risks.
The CSFC said it would buy more shares of small and medium-sized companies, which have suffered the biggest losses.
Chen said: The market is panicking and the government is trying to save it, so we are having something like a conflict between the two powers and we are not sure which will be the strongest.
Ayako Sera, a senior market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank in Tokyo, said: Today is all about China, with Greece in the background  Shanghais early losses were like a cliff dive, which had a huge impact on investor sentiment.
The continued sell-offs came after a surprise interest rate cut by the central bank at the end of June. Relaxations in margin trading and other stability measures have done little to calm investors. Analysts said they expected the falls to continue.
I dont see it getting better, Balding said. There is not going to be a turn around within the next week or two. It probably has a long way to go.

Palestinian teenager 'shot in back by senior Israeli soldier while fleeing'
Claims by multiple witnesses that Mohammed Kasbeh, 17, was shot as he ran away appear consistent with medical examination of his body

A teenage Palestinian killed by a senior Israeli army officer last week was shot in the back and side while apparently fleeing, according to medical evidence and multiple Palestinian witness reports.
Mohammed Kasbeh, 17, was among a group of stone-throwers near a major Ramallah checkpoint when they broke the windscreen of a passing brigade commanders car with a rock. He died after being shot several times in his upper body by the officer.
After shooting Mohammed, the officer allegedly kicked the dying teenager on the ground before leaving the scene.
The killing of Mohammed near the Qalandia checkpoint last Friday received widespread coverage in the Israeli media, both because of the seniority of the officer involved  a brigade commander, Col Yisrael Shomer, and because of the support he received immediately after the shooting from senior members of Israels government, including education minister Naftali Bennett .

The killing was given extra prominence because two of Mohammeds brothers  aged 15 and 11  were also killed by the Israeli military during the second intifada , while a third brother survived being shot.
The incident occurred in the early morning when an Israeli vehicle in which Shomer was travelling with other soldiers drove along a section of road between the Palestinian neighbourhood of al-Ram and the Qalandia checkpoint towards a gate in the separation wall used by the Israeli military.
What appears not to be in dispute is that at a roundabout close to the Qalandia checkpoint a group of youths threw stones at the vehicle, breaking its windscreen. It is what happened next that is at the centre of the disputed claims.
According to the first account of the Israeli military, under a hail of rocks Shomer exited the car and  fearing for his life  shot and killed one of the group amid continued stone-throwing.
Multiple Palestinian eyewitnesses, however, tell another story. They claim that the Israeli car pulled over by the side of the road and two or three soldiers exited, chased the fleeing youths for a few metres before Shomer paused, took aim and shot Mohammed several times as he ran away  claims that seem consistent with the medical examination of his body.
As Mohammed lay dying, say witnesses, Shomer approached him and kicked or pushed him with his foot before leaving and driving away.
None of the officers in the car suffered any injuries.
A medical report  obtained by the Guardian  supported by an interview with the doctor who examined Mohammed when his body was admitted to hospital  describes how he was shot in the back and obliquely in the side of the head  not front on  with the most serious injury a gunshot wound penetrating his upper left back. A second bullet entered his mouth  also from the side  becoming lodged in his jaw.
A description of the fatal shooting by two Palestinian witnesses interviewed by the Guardian suggests  if these accounts are accurate  the Israeli soldiers involved were in breach of the militarys own recommendations over the use of live ammunition in attempted arrests  appropriate for a fleeing individual  firing at the upper body, not the legs.
Fadi Ziad was working at a petrol station about 30 metres from where Mohammed was shot. It was around 6.30 in the morning, Ziad told the Guardian. There were three young guys at the roundabout who were throwing rocks. A jeep came past  not one of the ordinary ones but one the officers use  and they threw rocks at it.

According to Ziad, the soldiers pulled over their car and stopped on the opposite side of the road to where he was watching.
They got out. There were two with helmets and a soldier without a helmet. He said the soldier without a helmet appeared to be older.
They started chasing the youths. The one who was shot was moving with his back towards them but with his head turned towards where they were. He was running away sideways on. The soldiers were 10 to 15 metres from the youths when they shot the one who died. After he fell on the ground the soldier without the helmet went and checked him and kicked him.
At Mohammeds funeral on Friday, his grief-stricken friend Ahmad Tahir  one of the youths present throwing stones  recounted an identical story. He was running away, he said. He also said that after the shooting one of the soldiers kicked the prone teenager.
Among those who defended Shomers action on the basis of what was known at the time was Bennett, who wrote on his Facebook page: I completely stand behind the Binyamin Brigade commander that acted facing a terrorist to defend his own life and the lives of his soldiers. This is how a commander in the IDF should act. The people of Israel are behind you.
Shomers action was also defended by the deputy defence minister, Eli Ben Dahan, and his own commanding officer despite the fact that an ongoing military police investigation was opened into the killing.
The human rights group BTselem  which conducted its own investigation into the killing  said on Tuesday that its investigation had heard exactly the same evidence from three witnesses separate from the ones interviewed by the Guardian.
The BTselem witnesses only differ from Fadi Ziads account in saying it was two not three soldiers who left the vehicle.
We spoke to Haroun Hazim, another of the youths there with Mohammed, said Itamar Barak, a researcher with the group. He said they were at the roundabout when someone shouted that a military vehicle was approaching.
Then a stone was thrown. The vehicle stopped immediately and he says he people exited the car, the driver and the high-ranking officer.
The officer ran a few metres and the youths ran and tried to hide but Kasbeh was quite visible. The officer then set himself in position and fired several shots and then came and kicked him.
Two other witnesses, drivers from Jenin who were parked nearby, also gave the group the same account, saying after Mohammed was shot the officer checked the body with his foot.
Sarit Michaeli of BTselem added: The central issue for us is that this action by the highest-ranking officer in the region  backed up by military commanders  suggests that the disproportionate use of force wont be sanctioned but will condoned. And that s is very dangerous.
The Israel Defence Forces declined to answer any specific questions relating to the incident but released the following general statement: The commander and his forces, who were on their way to Qalandiya crossing, were attacked by a number of Palestinians hurling stones at their vehicle at close range. The commander, fearing a lynch that would place his subordinates and himself mortal danger, exited his vehicle and implemented standard procedure for the apprehension of suspects. Military police investigations are automatically opened into all incidents resulting in death in the West Bank.

Burma to hold general election on 8 November

Burma will hold a general election on 8 November in a vote that holds the promise of being the next step towards full democracy for a nation run by a repressive military junta for nearly half a century.
The announcement on Wednesday came two weeks after Burmas parliament voted against constitutional amendments that observers said would allow Aung San Suu Kyi  who spent 15 years under house arrest  to run for the presidency. But the Nobel peace laureates National League for Democracy party is expected to win a considerable number of seats in both houses of parliament.
The general election will be held on 8 November. The union election commission will announce further details later, Thant Zin Aung, deputy director of the election commission, told Agence France-Presse.
The NLD won the election in 1990 but the result was ignored by the military. The party boycotted the next nationwide poll, which was not held until 2010 and was condemned by international observers for widespread irregularities.

But after 2011, when President Thein Seins administration eased censorship laws and released political prisoners, the NLD stood in 2012 by-elections, winning 43 of the 44 seats it contested.
Thant Myint-U, a Burmese historian and author, said that if the NLD was convinced the elections were being conducted fairly, it would take part.
If the elections are indeed free and fair, we will at least have a parliament that is 75% elected [a quarter of seats are reserved for unelected soldiers] and a government that will emerge from some sort of accommodation between elected MPs and the army  a big step forward from anything weve had the past half century, even if still far from democracy, he told the Guardian after the announcement of the election date.
He said the polls would only be the start of a somewhat labyrinthine process leading to the selection of a new president early next year and a new government taking office in March. Well have more than four months of pure politics, lots of time for posturing and negotiation, and at least a possibility of political deadlock, he added.
About 30 million people are eligible to vote in Burma, a country left isolated by the military, whose rule was defined by its widespread oppression, violence and economic stagnation.
Thein Sein, a former general, pushed through reforms which lifted western sanctions, but the NLD and activists say many are superficial. Political prisoners remain in jail and the media is strictly controlled.
Aung San Suu Kyi and rights campaigners have increasingly warned that reforms have stalled or even reversed in some areas, with dozens of student protesters behind bars and the tightening of media freedoms.

The NLD leader is barred from running for president because of a constitution provision excluding those with foreign children from the top office. Her late husband was British and she has two British sons.
Still, while she may be blocked from the top job, the ruling, military-backed Union Solidarity and Development party is facing increasing fractiousness within its ranks. Thein Sein, who was widely seen as one-term leader, is now publicly mulling a second tilt.

The work never stops if you are Europes most powerful leader.
After Tuesdays fractious summit in Brussels, Angela Merkel was back in Berlin for a meeting with her cabinet this morning. She is pictured here with Sigmar Gabriel, her vice chancellor, who warned Greeks they had torn down the last bridges by voting against the EU bailout plan.

Next on the the German chancellors agenda is a two-day trip to the Balkans, where she will visit Albania, Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina - all countries that aspire to join the EU.

But the Greek debt crisis is never far away, as the economic chaos ripples across the region.
Reuters in Tirana has a good account of how the Greek crisis is hurting its neighbours.
Greeces debt crisis is inflicting hardship on Greeks but the shockwave is fanning out too into its ex-Communist neighbours which are economically dependent on Greece and, because they are poorer, even less well equipped to deal with the consequences.
The potential impact on countries such as Albania, Kosovo, Serbia, Macedonia and Bulgaria is likely to be on the agenda of German Chancellor Angela Merkel - a central player in the Greek debt drama - when she visits the region starting on Wednesday.
With Greece losing its appeal as a source of earnings for Albanian migrant workers, more are heading to Germany instead. Some 16,000 Albanians have sought asylum in Germany from January to May, with 4,900 arrivals in May alone.
The Greeks have no money, they are themselves in a crisis, [one Albanian worker told Reuters]. They told us to come and work again in two weeks and get the money.
Among an estimated 600,000 Albanians who work temporarily in Greece, he and his friends had been making the trip for the past eight years. Things had been lean since the 2008 financial crisis but, he said, never so bad as now.
They never kept money from us for agriculture jobs, but could do nothing about the banks this time, he said.

The first female nominee for Afghanistans supreme court has failed to win enough votes in parliament.
Anisa Rassouli received 88 votes, nine short of the 97 needed for her nomination to pass. Zahir Qadir, the deputy parliamentary speaker who was chairing the session, said: We ask the president [Ashraf Ghani] to nominate another individual for this position.
Wednesdays vote came after clerics and conservatives lined up to criticise the choice of Rassouli, who has been a judge for 24 years and is the current head of Kabuls juvenile court. They claimed only men were fit to sit in the highest court in the country.
Last month, one MP made his views clear. Menstruating women were considered unclean in Islam and were not allowed to touch the Quran, Qazi Nazeer Hanafi said. As judges put their hands on the holy book every day, and it was unfeasible for a supreme court judge to take a week off every month, ran his logic, Rassoulis appointment should be opposed.
It is against Islamic law. I will make a campaign and tell the other brothers to vote against her, said Hanafi. It would be a crime if I voted for her.

Shams-ul Rahman Frotan, a member of the Ulema council, an influential group of clerics, told Reuters : We told [the president] that a woman cannot be a judge in capital crimes and other serious criminal issues.
Amid the controversy, Rassouli remained calm, weighing her words carefully and shrugging off rebukes in an interview with the Guardian last month. There is nothing under sharia that prevents me from becoming a supreme court judge, she said.
By nominating a woman to the supreme court, Ghani had hoped to fulfil a promise from his campaign trail, as he did when he recently named four female ministers.
Rights advocates had hoped the presence of a woman on the supreme court could help overhaul Afghanistans inherently sexist legal system. Family and marital law favours men, and a womans testimony is worth half that of a man. The vast majority of girls and women in Afghanistans prisons have been jailed for moral crimes, such as running away from home to escape a violent husband.
Speaking after the vote, lawmaker Shukria Barakzai, an outspoken womens rights advocate, told Reuters: I hope the president nominates another woman for this position.
After taking a law degree at Kabul University, Rassaouli became a judge at 23, and as the chair of the Afghan Female Judges Association has fought for three years to get a woman on the supreme court panel.
Aged 47, unmarried and living with her parents and siblings, Rassouli has impressed Afghan and foreign colleagues with her work in the capitals juvenile court.
Related: Afghanistan growing more receptive on women's rights, says British ambassador
Had her nomination been approved, one imminent challenge for Rassouli would have been to build Afghans trust in the formal legal system. In rural areas in particular, many people prefer local, informal councils to courts of law, which are often inaccessible and reputed to be slow and corrupt. However, the informal system often grants impunity to male suspects, such as those accused of domestic violence.
Women who prefer to go to village courts dont have enough information and are uneducated. If I talk to them face to face, I can explain why the formal system is better, Rassouli said last month. The main problem is security. We could bring the courts to the villages if there was better security, and then people wouldnt use the local councils.
Rassouli said her presence at the supreme court could potentially help women gain faith in the legal system. We have a lot of women who come to the supreme court asking about their rights. Women are more comfortable talking to a female judge, so theres need for me to be there, she said.
After Wednesdays vote, that need appears far from being fulfilled.

Irish abortion survey finds majority of people support decriminalisation
Amnesty poll reveals shift in attitudes with 65% saying they want abortion decriminalised and 81% favouring some liberalisation of legislation

Two-thirds of Irish people want abortion decriminalised, according to a survey that signals a major shift in views on a womans right to choose in a country that still outlaws most terminations.
Eight out of 10 people polled for Amnesty International favoured some liberalisation of the law, and 65% said abortion should be decriminalised.
Two years ago, Irelands parliament, the Dil, passed legislation allowing for abortion in extremely limited cases of medical emergencies or when there is risk of suicide if pregnancy goes to full term. Under the law, doctors and medical professionals have the right ultimately to determine if a womans life is at risk in these circumstances.
Abortion remains unavailable, for instance, to Irish women who are raped or whose pregnancies are doomed as a result of foetal abnormalities.
The findings of the poll, based on 1,000 telephone interviews in May, demonstrate a widespread lack of knowledge about the legal risk of carrying out abortions in Ireland .
Sixty-four per cent of those surveyed did not know that it is a crime to get an abortion in Ireland when a womans life is not at risk. Only 9% knew that having an unlawful abortion can lead to up to 14 years in jail.
Seventy-one per cent agreed that classifying abortion as a crime contributes to the distress and stigma felt by women who have had abortions and 45% supported a womans right to choose for non-medical reasons.
Amnesty said the results from the survey proved that Irish views on abortion have undergone a major transformation.
Colm OGorman, Amnestys executive director in Ireland, said: People in Ireland are now, on the whole, more understanding of the situations women find themselves in and firmly believe that women should not be criminalised for having an abortion.
This poll demonstrates that on the issue of abortion Irelands people are clearly ahead of their government leaders. The Irish government should put this issue to the people as a matter of priority. Decriminalising abortion is not only a human rights obligation  it is what people in Ireland want.
In 1983, when the Catholic hierarchy still exercised huge political influence in Ireland, the electorate endorsed article 8, an amendment to the countrys constitution that in effect made an embryo after conception a citizen of the state, by 67% to 33%.
By 2002, however, the gap between the anti-abortion majority and those in favour of some limited form of abortion in Ireland had narrowed. An attempt by anti-abortion campaigners to further restrict access to abortion was defeated in the 2002 referendum. But the outcome was extremely close, with just over 10,500 votes separating the two sides  50.42% voted no and 49.58% voted yes to a proposition to ban abortion in all circumstances.
Amnesty is backing calls in the republic to repeal article 8 of the Irish constitution, and last month issued a report saying Irelands abortion laws violated universal human rights. Subsequently the United Nations has instructed the republic to liberalise its laws on terminations.
Despite growing international pressure though, the Fine Gael-Labour coalition is unlikely to hold a referendum on article 8 before next years general election. Abortion remains one the most controversial issues in Irish politics, and even minor tinkering has caused schisms within Fine Gael.

Regardless of the ban and the continued existence of article 8, thousands of Irish women every year travel to Britain to terminate their pregnancies.
The current government attempted to liberalise the anti-abortion laws in the aftermath of the death of Savita Halappanavar, who died from sepsis after having a miscarriage in October 2012. The Indian dentist, who had been 17 weeks pregnant, was denied an emergency abortion in Galway University hospital that would have saved her life. The medical team treating her believed they could detect a foetal heartbeat and refused her the life-saving termination. An inquest in Galway city concluded that she had died from medical misadventure .
Her death became the focus of an international outcry over Irelands strict anti-abortion laws.
Last year, the latest legislation, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, was severely tested after medics refused an abortion to a rape victim and asylum seeker who protested that she would take her own life if she was forced to go full term into the pregnancy. The woman was so desperate to obtain an abortion that she tried to illegally enter Britain via Birkenhead but was arrested and deported back to Ireland because she had no official papers. She was then forced to give birth in Ireland.

Is Bernie Sanders really a socialist? Or just redefining socialism for America?
The Democratic candidate describes himself as one, but it can be hard to detect the traditional hallmarks of socialism at his increasingly popular rallies

Since the days of Joe McCarthys communist witch-hunts, American politics has rarely seen a red scare to match that greeting the surging popularity of Bernie Sanders .
The self-declared socialist senator from Vermont, who is now challenging Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, is not even hiding under the bed; he would sooner jump up and down on the mattress than disown his leftwing past .
He remains a long-shot to win the Democratic partys nomination, let alone the White House, but moderate colleagues in the Senate warn nonetheless that the media is failing to expose his extreme liberal agenda .
Republican opponents argue that the sight of an honest-to-goodness socialist even gaining on Clinton in the polls proves just how dangerously radical the Democratic party has become.
Yet by international or historical standards, it can be hard to detect the traditional hallmarks of socialism in the increasingly popular, and populist, rallies of Comrade Sanders.
His proposals for Canadian-style universal healthcare and subsidised higher education, though bold by US standards, would once not have looked out of place in the manifesto of the British Conservative party  never mind those of resurgent European leftists like Syriza of Greece or Podemos of Spain.
Similar promises to tackle the power of investment banks and restore the earnings potential of the middle class are made not just by European social democrats but other Washington politicians too, such as Elizabeth Warren.
And while calls for progressive tax rises and modest hikes in social security and the minimum wage might echo the early French socialists who first wrote from each according to his ability, to each according to his need, they are a far cry from the policies of the Marxists who later used that slogan to justify nationalising the commanding heights of industry.

For though he talks of the need for a political revolution and may have briefly flirted with nationalisation in the 1970s, Sanders has always stressed his roots in the American tradition of democratic socialism rather than allow any room for McCarthyite confusion.
Whether this would qualify as socialist on the streets of Paris or in the mines of South Wales, those who have studied the American history of the term claim he therefore deserves the benefit of the doubt.
Given that socialism hasnt exactly been a thriving concern in the United States and given that its often hurled as an insult, for someone to voluntarily take on the term, I cut them some slack, says Eric Arnesen, a history professor at George Washington University , who points to faith in government to correct economic injustice as the key hallmark of the word.
If you check enough of those boxes, and I think Sanders does, then you are entitled to call yourself a socialist and be called one by your opponents.
Jack Ross, author of a new history of the Socialist Party of America , agrees that Sanders draws inspiration from the partys heyday in the 1920s and 1930s, though he avoided the bitter splits that dogged the national movement in the 1970s and 1980s by escaping to the calmer climes of Vermont.
Even if he is not the inheritor, he is provoking the right questions, says Ross. For all the ways that Bernie Sanders is a product of a very different time and place, he represents enough of a link to the [American socialist] past.
There are some within the US who are more willing to question these credentials, however. Supporters of the Green party, for example, have accused Sanders of selling out by dropping his independent status  the label under which he has been elected to Congress since 1990  to seek the Democratic nomination.
A series of articles in the radical Jacobin magazine also point to the failure of other progressive champions such as George McGovern and Howard Dean to make much headway inside a party dominated by the Washington establishment.
Like many leftists before him, the Democratic party has co-opted and changed Sanders, using him to help hinder the development of a genuine alternative to the capitalist parties, added Ashley Smith in Socialist Worker .
But Sanders has been adamant from the outset of his campaign that he does not want to follow third-party candidates like Ralph Nader and risk letting in a Republican president by splitting the progressive vote, which is why he stood as a Democrat and not an independent, he said.
Perhaps a more interesting question therefore is not whether Bernie Sanders qualifies as a socialist among the purists but whether he can rehabilitate the word as a more neutral political term in the capitalist heartlands of America.

He has the capacity to reintroduce the word socialism without its negative connotations, argues Arnesen. I dont know how likely it is, but it is certainly a possibility that in the current environment will lose some of the sting it once had.
He believes it may help explain why Sanders is so willing to continue being described in this way, despite the words past toxicity.
If you have called yourself over the years a socialist and if your opponents are hurling the term at you, you can either run from the term and then you look like a flip-flopper or you can take the label and say: And your point is? Its not a dirty word, adds Arnesen.
Ross agrees it is time to bury the semantic dogma and rescue the word from critics on the right in the same way that liberal gradually made a recovery after George HW Bush used it to bash Michael Dukakis so effectively in the 1980s.
As far as I am concerned the word socialist is as elastic in its meaning as liberal and conservative, he argues. To a large extent whats happened with the word socialism is a boomerang effect after the way of a lot of right-wingers flung it at Obama.
But beyond simply expanding the narrowly permissible lexicon of the Washington beltway, those who have studied the way American socialists have been traduced as communist sympathisers over the decades hope Sanders lack of shame over the S-word might signal a more historic shift.
A generation after the cold war, there deserves to be a reexamination of socialism on its own terms, says Ross. It will have a salutatory effect on the liberal left.

Angela Lita Boitano was standing about 50 meters away from her daughter Adriana when a car pulled up carrying a group of men who she later learned were Argentinian military policemen dressed as civilians.
They grabbed 24-year-old Adriana and bundled her into the car before speeding away. Lita never saw her daughter again. It was the second time tragedy had befallen Boitano: a year earlier, in 1976, her 20-year old son, Michelangelo, had disappeared on his way home.
As many as 30,000 people are thought to have joined the ranks of Argentinas desaparecidos, the term used for political opponents of Argentinas 1976-83 dictatorship who were kidnapped, tortured for information and then made to vanish.
For Boitano, the loss of her two children not long after she was widowed in 1968 transformed her into an activist, a role she still plays today, at the age of 83.
The strength to live came from our children  to search for them in the hope that they would be alive. Because I was left with nobody, she told the Guardian.
That search has taken her all the way inside the halls of the Vatican, where, she believes, meticulous files have been kept about the people who disappeared . These files were principally collected through the papal nuncios office in Buenos Aires at the time, where victims families would file written complaints about the disappearances.
South Americas bloody history with military dictatorship will return to the spotlight on Wednesday when Pope Francis touches down in Bolivia, where he is expected to pray at the site where the body of a Jesuit priest, Father Lus Espinal, was found in 1980 after he was kidnapped, tortured and killed by paramilitaries.
The murder was met with outrage and marked a turning point from the countrys history of dictatorships to democracy. It was the beginning of the democracy that we continue having in Bolivia, Father Xavier Albo told the Catholic news site The Pilot , with all the ups and downs that democracies have.

Pope Franciss recognition of Espinal amid his South American tour  where he has urged the faithful to be wary of all totalitarian, ideological or sectarian schemes  highlights the role some clergy played in trying to speak out against dictatorships during the politically tumultuous 1970s and 80s.
But it also returns the focus to a period when other Catholic leaders  in Argentina and elsewhere  actively supported the militarys crusade against leftwing activists and guerrilla groups.
In Argentina, where Francis was long known as Father Bergoglio before his 2013 election to the papacy, the churchs role was divided. A few members of the clergy played a part in the regimes killing. Father Christian von Wernich is currently serving a life sentence for numerous cases of kidnapping, torture and murder in which he was involved at death camps run by the police force back then.
Others became martyrs. Bishop Enrique Angelelli of the northern province of La Rioja was killed by the dictatorship for publicly opposing its killing methods in August 1976.

Although the role of Pope Francis , then head of the Jesuit order in Argentina, has been called into doubt in the past, he has always made it clear he had no sympathies for the military regime. In 2006, on the 30th anniversary of Angelellis murder, then Cardinal Bergoglio said the bishop was stoned for spreading the Gospel and paid for it with his blood.
Argentinas church itself recognised its failure to condemn the dictatorship. In a statement it issued in September 2000, Argentinas bishops apologised for their silence and the effective participation of some clergymen in torture, delation, political persecution during the regime.
But Boitano, the Argentine activist who lost her two children, is still waiting for a more meaningful recognition by the Vatican of the role some clergy played during the dirty war.
She recalls the story of the late Argentine poet Juan Gelman , whose son and daughter-in-law, who was seven months pregnant, were disappeared.
Boitano said that while he was in political exile in 1978, Gelman went to the Vatican to hunt for clues about whether his grandchild had survived. There, an official confirmed that his daughter-in-law had indeed given birth while she was in a detention camp.
Years later, in 1990, Gelmans sons remains were found in a cement-filled barrel. His daughter-in-law, Maria Claudia, who was Uruguayan, had been flown to Uruguay and given birth before her presumed death. In 2000, Gelman discovered his granddaughter and the two eventually met.
Boitano believes the church knew many of these critical details as early as 1978, but did nothing to help victims families. Nuns were also sometimes on hand for the birth of children born by pregnant victims.

The nuns went out to buy the first clothes for the kids, she said. Babies of the disappeared were handed on to be brought up by families of servicemen or regime supporters, and have often grown up unaware of their own histories.
Boitano believes that Vatican records could help pin down the exact death toll, and possibly shed new light on where people were last seen before they vanished.
Opening the archives completely might mean finding data that neither the relatives nor the judges know. Imagine that I disappeared from one day to the next and no one knows what happened, and the Vatican in its archive has four or five different complaints, from different people asking where I am, she said. A judge can connect all the complaints and perhaps he/she could find a link between them and could find where the military could have brought me.
The fate of her own children has never emerged, though some claimed that Michelangelo was seen at a concentration camp at the Mechanical School of the Navy in Buenos Aires.
Boitano  who says an official once told her that the church kept two books, listing the names of the living, and of the dead  says she has been told by Francis himself that the archive would soon be open to anyone who sought access to it.
[Now] we have to wait. I hope that he will abide by his promises, she said.
She is also seeking a statement of self-criticism from the church  an acknowledgement that it stayed silent when it needed to speak  and was told one was forthcoming.
The Vatican declined to comment on whether it was indeed preparing such a statement.
I would say Pope Francis was part of the complicity of silence, said Boitano.
This article was amended on 8 July 2015 to change Mechanical School of the Army to Mechanical School of the Navy.

Bill Cosbys admission under oath that he drugged a woman before having sex with her has split the comedians defenders, with at least two shifting their stance as others continue to warn against passing judgment.
Singer Jill Scott, who defended Cosby last year against the allegations from dozens of women that he attempted to sexually assault them, tweeted late on Monday: I stood by a man I respected and loved. I was wrong.
On Monday, a federal judge in Philadelphia unsealed Cosbys 2005 testimony in which the comedian admitted giving a woman quaaludes in order to have sex with her. The suit, filed by another woman, ended in a settlement.
Sadly his own testimony offers proof of terrible deeds, which is all I have ever required to believe the accusations, Scott wrote.
Im not sorry for standing by my mentor. Im sorry the accusations [are] true, she added.
Last year, Scott had demanded proof for the alleged allegations that Cosby had over several decades drugged and assaulted women. Cosby tweeted his thanks to her and to fellow comedian Whoopi Goldberg, who had said she wanted the press to question the woman who accused him.
On Tuesday, Goldberg still refused to condemn Cosby. On the daytime talkshow The View she said: In America, still, I know its a shock, but youre actually  were innocent until proven guilty. He has not been proven.
Goldberg again cast doubt on the many claims of abuse levelled against Cosby, saying: Well this was just, this was one woman, and I believe, I think this was in 2000.
She also dismissed the similarities among accusations and their preponderance. I dont like snap judgments cause Ive had snap judgments made on me, she said. So Im very, very careful.
Her co-panelist Raven-Symon, who starred as a child actor on The Cosby Show and last year called the accusations against her co-star disgusting , said she believed the court documents.
I dont really like to talk about it that much because hes the reason that Im on this panel and got my first job, she said, but now theres real facts.
Goldberg was not alone among entertainers who continue to deflect criticism from Cosby. On Tuesday, actor Faizon Love unleashed a Twitter rant that accused detractors of concentrating on  that bullshit , referring to the dozens of women who have accused Cosby of rape.
Instead, Love wrote, people should be concerned about violence and racism against black people. He suggested that people did not care enough about the June murders of nine black people in a church in South Carolina, for instance, a shooting that drew nationwide outrage and mourning .
The actor called his online opponents slaves who repeat everything that others say.
Another of Cosbys defenders, former co-star Phylicia Rashad, has so far not commented on the unsealed documents. In January, Rashad said the series of accusations were an orchestrated campaign about  the destruction of a legacy .
Were talking about a legacy that introduced and portrayed American culture in its diversity, Rashad said at the time. Its difficult for me to watch this legacy be erased as if it never happened.
In court on Friday, Cosbys lawyers said the documents were terribly embarrassing. They have so far not responded to questions for comment.
The attorney who represented Cosby in the 2005 case was Patrick OConnor, who is now chairman of the board of trustees at Temple University, where Cosby was a trustee for 32 years until his resignation late last year. The woman who brought the civil case forward, Andrea Constand, was a Temple employee.
The university did not immediately respond to a request to comment.

Agreement on lifting the sanctions imposed on Iran over its nuclear programme would be a giant step forward after decades of hostility by the United States, according to Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the Islamic republics former president and its greatest political survivor.
Rafsanjani, a close confidante of Ayatollah Khomeini, the leader of the Islamic revolution, and a heavyweight leader himself for 40 years, hailed Irans decision to negotiate directly with Washington. We have broken a taboo, he told the Guardian in a rare and exclusive interview in his Tehran office.
Rafsanjani is a highly influential supporter of the current president, Hassan Rouhani, whose election in 2013 paved the way for nuclear talks. He was speaking on Tuesday before it was announced that the Vienna negotiations between Iran, the US and five other world powers had been extended for an additional three days after missing a second deadline. The first deadline on 30 June also passed without agreement.
Having face-to-face negotiations is better than talking at long distance through the media, Rafsanjani said. Iran is dead serious. If the other parties are as serious we will have an agreement for sure. That Iran is talking directly to the US is a good move. We have broken a taboo.
Rafsanjani said US hostility to Iran had long been the main problem. Before the [1979] revolution the US was the main supporter of the Shahs regime and after the revolution, in the imposed war [with Iraq] it was against us too. Now in the nuclear talks, if we see a different US, it will have a positive impact on the Iranian public. It was not impossible that an American embassy  scene of the 444-day hostage saga from 1979 to 1981, and still known in Farsi as the nest of spies  could reopen in Tehran. But that depends on the behaviour of both sides.
He quoted Khomeinis famous saying: If the US behaves in a humane way we will have no problem with it.
Related: Its not like Argo: the trials of a tour guide in Iran
Rafsanjani, 80, is chairman of Irans expediency council, which mediates between parliament and the president under the overall authority of Khomeinis successor as supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei . Rafsanjani was de facto commander in chief of Iranian forces during the bloody eight-year war with Iraq. In his two terms as president from 1989 to 1997 he mended fences with the wealthy Gulf states, led by Saudi Arabia, which had supported Saddam Hussein.
Now, at a time of high tension, strategic rivalry and sectarian tensions across the region, he attacked the Saudis for interfering in the nuclear talks as well their bombardment of the Yemeni people.
The Saudis had also lost their sensitivity to the Palestinian cause, he said. We would like to have friendly relations with them.
He added: The holy Quran says that Muslims are brothers and should live in brotherhood. They must not be tyrants to each other.
On hostility to Israel  a centrepiece of Iranian policy since 1979  he saw no prospect for change. We dont need to change. he said. We support the rights of Palestinians. We are not participating in any military action in Palestine but we advise them on political issues. As long as Palestinian rights are not taken into account we cannot have good relations with the US.
Israel, which has its own undeclared nuclear arsenal, opposes the emerging P5+1 agreement with Iran and sees Iran as a sworn enemy that backs the Palestinian movement Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Islamic State (Isis), referred to in Farsi, as in Arabic, by its pejorative name Daesh, was humiliating Islam. Iran was helping fight it in both Syria and Iraq at the request of their governments. Syria is under attack by so many terrorist groups, he said. We are against terrorism anywhere in the world.
Rafsanjani faced angry criticism in 2013 when he said that the Syrian government had used chemical weapons against its own people  a rare sign of dissent over Tehrans unstinting support for Syrias president, Bashar al-Assad.
Related: Post-sanctions Iran 'could be the best emerging market for years to come'
Rafsanjani, like Rouhani, is usually described as a pragmatic moderate rather than a reformist in the lexicon of Irans complex political system. He said he was optimistic about the future of the country because it had an increasingly educated population and elections at all levels.
Hardliners dislike him and often insult him by referring to him without his clerical title, accusing him of abandoning the revolutionary ideology of the past and advocating rapprochement with the US  still the Great Satan to that camp. He lost a third presidential bid to the populist Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2005. Two of his children were prosecuted in the wake of the stolen election that gave Ahmadinejad a second term in 2009. Sanctions over the nuclear issue were ratcheted up after that.
In July 2009, as the post-election crackdown intensified, Rafsanjani gave a famous sermon criticising restrictions on freedom of expression and the detention of political activists. Asked in the interview about a continuing lack of personal and cultural freedoms under a system which routinely blocks access to websites and social media sites, and about the espionage trial of the Washington Post journalist, Jason Rezaian, a dual US and Iranian national, Rafsanjani answered simply: People wisely participate in elections. The people who are elected decide.

The South Carolina senate gave its final approval on Tuesday to removing the Confederate flag from the capitol grounds, but across the hall in the house of representatives, Republicans quietly sought a way to make a last stand to preserve some kind of symbol honoring their southern ancestors at the state house.
The House was scheduled to begin debate on Wednesday on the bill to take down the flag and its pole and send the banner to the states Confederate relic room. Governor Nikki Haley and business leaders support the proposal.

To stress the chambers unity after Tuesdays 36-3 vote, senators invited the widow of their slain colleague Clementa Pinckney to the floor. She stood just inside the door in a black dress, only a few feet from her husbands desk, which was draped in black cloth with a single white rose on top. Every member stood as she entered and later walked up to her, offering condolences.
After the flag was pulled off the state house dome 15 years ago, it was called a settled issue. The banner was instead moved to a monument honoring Confederate soldiers elsewhere on the capitol grounds.
But the flag debate swiftly gained urgency last month after Pinckney and eight other black people were fatally shot at a historic African American church in Charleston. A white gunman who police said was motivated by racial hatred is charged in the attack.
Dylann Roof was indicted on Tuesday on nine counts of murder, three counts of attempted murder and a weapons charge.
Haley and other conservatives have said they called for the flag to come down in part because of photos showing Roof posing with the Confederate symbol.
If the house goes along with the senates bill, the flag could be removed by the end of the week. But if the house changes the bill, either the senate would have to agree with the changes or lawmakers would have to reconcile their differences in a conference committee, possibly delaying action for weeks. Several senators said the lopsided vote shows they do not want their bill to change.
Many Republicans in the house insist the flag will come down because of its association with racist groups. But they think lawmakers should at least discuss replacing it with a different flag that flew over Confederate troops.
Representative Mike Pitts plans to propose several possible flags for the pole and believes he has a majority to pass them. Completely removing the flagpole, he said, would scrub history, which includes family members from his Laurens county home and from the mountains of North Carolina and Virginia.
I guess my plan for tomorrow is to be a lot like my ancestors were at the Bloody Angle, Pitts said, referring to part of a Virginia battlefield where fighting raged for nearly 24 hours in 1864, leaving Confederate dead stacked four deep behind their fortifications. And fight until I have nothing left to fight with.
Pitts favorite amendment would place on the pole the flag of the 1st South Carolina volunteers regiment, which is a blue flag similar to the state flag with its Palmetto tree and crescent moon but with a wreath around the tree. Similar art is etched on a wall inside the state house, Pitts said.
Any change to the senate bill is unacceptable to the 46 Democrats in the 124-member house  a critical number because some Democrats will have to support any bill to take down the flag to reach the two-thirds threshold required by law, the minority leader, Todd Rutherford, said.
It will become the new symbol, Rutherford said of any flag that goes up beside the monument to Confederate soldiers. It will be the new vestige of racism.
Asked if the GOP was using the idea of an alternative flag simply to avoid bringing down the existing banner, Democratic representative Joe Neal, elected in 1992, said he thinks most Republicans are willing to remove the flag and pole entirely.
I think a majority wants to do this. There is a minority that is dead set against it, Neal said. Well see, when that vote comes up, who they are.
Tuesdays senate vote lacked drama, nearly matching the vote from the day before. But minutes after, the chamber hushed and all 45 senators stood up as Jennifer Pinckney entered.
On 17 June, she locked herself in an office with one of the slain senators two daughters as the gunman fired dozens of shots in her husbands Emanuel African Methodist church. Since then, her only appearances have been at her husbands viewing and funeral.
She did not speak publicly at the capitol. Instead, family attorney and Clementa Pinckneys fellow senator Gerald Malloy spoke on her behalf. Malloy said he was proud that the senate followed the example of the Emanuel AME families who offered forgiveness to the gunman. He cited lawmakers willingness to accept that the Confederate flag is a painful symbol to many South Carolinians who are not in their party nor of their race.
She wanted to show her gratitude, Malloy said of Pinckneys widow. As you can see, Clementa shined on her as well. His grace is contagious. It is contagious throughout this state.

Afghan officials and Taliban representatives will resume talks in Pakistan after the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, Pakistans foreign office has said, following a groundbreaking meeting on Tuesday .
Representatives of China and the US also took part in discussions in the popular hill town resort of Murree, which is an hours drive from the capital Islamabad.
A statement by the Pakistani foreign ministry said both sides were duly mandated by their respective leadership and expressed their collective desire to bring peace to Afghanistan and the region.
Doubts had been raised about the value of a Pakistani-brokered meeting held between the two sides in the Chinese city of Urumqi in May after a Taliban spokesman said the militants involved had not been officially authorised to talk.

The Taliban have so far refused to comment on reports of the Tuesday meeting, which began with an iftar  the sunset meal when Muslims break their Ramadan fast  and continued until the early hours of Wednesday morning.
The participants agreed to continue talks to create an environment conducive for peace and reconciliation process, the statement said.
In the past, the Taliban have refused face-to-face meetings with what they call Afghanistans puppet government, insisting they would only negotiate with the US.
Although the Tuesday meeting was held under the auspices of the high peace council, a body established to operate at arms length to the government, the delegation included Hekmat Karzai, Afghanistans deputy foreign minister and nephew of former president Hamid Karzai.
A Pakistani official said both sides accepted the need for confidence-building measures.
The government of the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, has been anxious to secure ceasefires with the insurgents. The involvement of both Chinese and US diplomats underlines the powerful international consensus over the need for a political deal in Afghanistan. China is worried about the Islamist insurgencies in Pakistan and Afghanistan spilling over into its western province of Xinjiang, home to a restive Muslim Uighur population.
There are also concerns in the US about the countrys long-term ability to sustain the billions of dollars needed to prop up Afghanistans outsized security forces as it struggles to cope with a raging Taliban-led insurgency.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest welcomed the Murree meeting as an an important step toward advancing prospects for a credible peace.
The other country that will be vital to the success of any peace process is Pakistan, which many Afghans believe remains wedded to its long-held policy of allowing the Taliban to operate freely in its territory in order to destabilise a troublesome neighbour.
Pakistan insists it is committed to peace. In May, the countrys prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, publicly assured Ghani that the enemies of Afghanistan cannot be friends of Pakistan.
That Tuesdays talks were held in Pakistan and with the apparent support of the Talibans leadership could relieve some of the political pressure on the Afghan president, who has been severely criticised at home for his attempts to cultivate Pakistan with a series of concessions that would have been unthinkable under his predecessor.
Analysts warn a deal with the Taliban may not end the bloodshed in Afghanistan given the movement is increasingly split, with a homegrown branch of Islamic State attracting defectors from other militant groups.
Taliban field commanders are also said to be resentful of political figures within the movement who do not share the hardships of the frontline. Whereas some in the movement are keen to strike a deal with the Afghan government, many fighters are said to believe a military victory against the government is increasingly possible given the continuing withdrawal of US forces.

        <title>Canadian election: opposition parties urge new ties with aboriginal people</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/07/canada-election-aboriginal-opposition-parties-first-nations</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Related: Unsolved murders of indigenous women reflect Canada's history of silence
Speaking at the annual meeting of the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) on Tuesday, the leaders of the New Democrat and Liberal parties also promised to call a nationwide inquiry into the high rates of missing and murdered aboriginal women and girls if they won the 19 October federal election.
I believe it is time for a new era, one that embraces a true nation-to-nation relationship, built on respect, and above all, makes meaningful progress when it comes to bringing about change, said the New Democrats Thomas Mulcair.
Mulcair and Liberal leader Justin Trudeau spent the day meeting with regional chiefs and First Nations leaders at the annual conference of the AFN  a largely federally funded national advocacy group.
Mulcair and Trudeau also pledged to fund education reforms, ensure that government decisions respect treaty rights, and implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People, a 2007 document to protect indigenous people from discrimination.
Many AFN delegates openly expressed their dissatisfaction with the ruling Conservative party of Stephen Harper.
I have no qualms in standing here and saying I have lost all faith in this federal government, said Manitoba Grand Chief Derek Nepinak, before urging the crowd to vote strategically against Conservative candidates in their ridings.
The Conservatives, who have been in power since 2006, did not send a representative to the meeting, but a spokeswoman for the federal aboriginal affairs minister, Bernard Valcourt, said he remained committed to working with all willing First Nation partners on shared priorities.
Last month, the AFN announced it had pinpointed 51 ridings out of 338 across Canada where the aboriginal vote could have an impact  a number National Chief Perry Bellegarde noted could mean the difference between a majority and a minority government after the election.
In an interview, Bellegarde was careful to underscore his non-partisanship, arguing the point of highlighting those ridings was to show that aboriginals could have a strong political voice if they chose to.
As national chief I have to work with whoever gets elected, he told the Guardian, though he called the relationship between the AFN and the Conservatives unnecessarily adversarial.
That relationship wasnt always so frosty.
In 2008, the prime minister, Stephen Harper, offered an historic full apology in the House of Commons on behalf of Canadians for the residential school system which saw 150,000 children forcibly removed from their families. But the Conservative government has since found itself repeatedly at odds with First Nations.
The recent Truth and Reconciliation summary report into Canadas residential school system noted the relationship between the federal government and aboriginal peoples was deteriorating over divisive conflicts over Aboriginal education, child welfare, and justice.
During that reports release last month, the aboriginal affairs minister remained seated as the audience stood to applaud during for a call for an inquiry into missing and murdered aboriginal women.
Harper has repeatedly rejected calls for an inquiry.
It remains to be seen whether aboriginal Canadians will be able to make political waves this election.
A 2013 analysis by Eric Grenier, who runs a popular poll tracking website, indicated that when aboriginal people did vote, they tended to lean towards the New Democrats. He also found that, had they turned out in force in the last general election in 2011, Conservatives might never have won a majority government.
But turnout among aboriginal voters in Canada has always been low  in the past four federal elections, on-reserve voting hovered around 45%,about 17.4% below the average nationwide voter turnout.
Canadas aboriginal population also trends younger and poorer than the national average, factors which tend to lower voter participation.
Bellegarde acknowledged the challenges but said that nonetheless, First Nations issues are now front and center in Canadas political conversation.
Were already a strong factor in this next federal election, he said.

German prosecutors have said they are seeking a three-and-a-half-year prison sentence for a 94-year-old former SS sergeant who served at the Auschwitz death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland during the second world war, saying his role there made him an accessory to murder.
Oskar Groening has admitted guarding prisoners baggage after they were unloaded from cattle cars, and collecting and counting money stolen from the new arrivals and sending it to Berlin.
Yesterday prosecutors told the Lneburg state court in their closing arguments that his role helped the camp function, and he should be convicted of 300,000 counts of accessory to murder for those killed while he was there.
Unusually for trials of former Nazi camp guards, Groening has been open about his past. When the trial began in April he said he felt moral guilt but it was up to the court to decide if he was legally guilty of a crime.
Dozens of Auschwitz survivors joined the trial as co-plaintiffs, and many of them testified about their own experiences in the death camp.
Last week Groening told the court their personal stories had brought home the enormity of the atrocities.

AC/DC drummer Phil Rudd has been sentenced in New Zealand to eight months of home detention after pleading guilty to threatening to kill a man who used to work for him, along with possession of methamphetamine and marijuana.
The 61-year-old drummer was sentenced in Tauranga district court on New Zealands North Island on Thursday. He had faced up to seven years in prison on the threatening to kill charge.
Rudd pleaded guilty to the charges in April, acknowledging in a court summary of facts that he had offered large amounts of cash, vehicles and a house to an associate after asking him to have the victim taken out.
He also acknowledged that he had directly said to the victim he was going to kill him.

Chinas securities regulator took the drastic step of banning shareholders with stakes of more than 5% from selling shares for the next six months in a bid to halt a plunge in stock prices that is starting to roil global financial markets.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said on its website late on Wednesday that it would deal severely with any shareholders who violated the rule.
The prohibition is also seen applying to foreign investors who hold stakes in Shanghai- or Shenzhen-listed companies, although most of their holdings are below 5%.
Chinas stock markets opened down again Thursday morning. The Shanghai Composite Index was down 2% while the Shenzhen Component Index opened down just over 1%.
Related: Chinese investors despair as gains wiped out in tumbling stock market
Asian equities also extended losses as concerns over Chinas market turmoil spread, while the safe-haven yen shot to a seven-week high as global risk appetite ebbed.
MSCIs broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed 0.2%, hovering near a 17-month low struck the previous day.
Japans Nikkei dropped 1.8%, Australian shares lost 0.3% and South Koreas Kospi fell 0.9%.
Iron ore prices plunged to fresh six-year lows on Thursday as the contagion hurt commodity markets, with resource-heavy economies such as Australia bearing the brunt.
The spot price of the commodity used to make steel took its biggest one-day hit ever overnight, falling 10% to $44.59 a tonne, analysts said, as demand in key market China continues to shrink.
An IG Markets strategist, Evan Lucas, said: Iron ore has just logged its worst trading day on record. The steel price in China is now cheaper per tonne than cabbage.
Separately, major shareholders of top Chinese banks including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and companies including Sinopec pledged to either maintain their holdings or increase their stakes in the listed companies.
The announcements came after Chinas stock market showed signs of seizing up on Wednesday, as companies scrambled to escape the rout by having their shares suspended and the CSRC warned of panic sentiment gripping investors.
Despite the turmoil, Chinas cabinet has said the country can reach its economic and social development targets this year. A statement from the State Council said: Positive signs have been increasing in the last two months and structural readjustment has been accelerated.
Chinas fiscal and monetary policies have been taking effect, while both development momentum and risk prevention capabilities have been strengthened.
The CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen closed down 6.8% on Wednesday, while the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 5.9%.
More than 30% has been knocked off the value of Chinese shares since mid-June, and for some global investors the fear that Chinas market turmoil will destabilise the real economy is now a bigger risk than the crisis in Greece .
Indeed, the Obama administration is worried the stock market crash could get in the way of Beijings economic reform agenda .
US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said on Wednesday: The concern, that is a real one, is what does it mean about long-term growth in China.
How do Chinese policymakers respond to this, and what does it mean in terms of core conditions of the economy?
More than 500 China-listed companies announced trading halts on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges on Wednesday, taking total suspensions to about 1,300  45% of the market or roughly $2.4tn worth of stock  as companies sought to sit out the carnage.
Du Changchun, an analyst at Northeast Securities, said: Ive never seen this kind of slump before. I dont think anyone has. Liquidity is totally depleted.
Originally, many wanted to hold blue chips. But since so many small caps are suspended from trading, the only way to reduce risk exposure is to sell blue chips.
Beijing, which has struggled for more than a week to bend the market to its will, unveiled yet another battery of measures and the Peoples Bank of China said it would step up support to brokerages enlisted to prop up shares.
Chinas Finance Ministry and a state investor, Central Huijin Investment Ltd, pledged not to reduce their shareholdings in the countrys big four banks: ICBC, China Construction Bank , Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China.
Sinopec Corp, Asias largest oil refiner, said in a filing on Wednesday that its controlling shareholder Sinopec Group had increased its stake in the listed company by buying 46 million domestic A shares in Shanghai, or 0.04% of the total issued share capital.
Nevertheless, world stock indexes fell overnight and the yen jumped against the dollar on concerns over Chinas market mayhem and lingering worries over the future of Greece in the eurozone.
The plunge in Chinas previously booming stock markets, which had more than doubled in the year to mid-June, is a major headache for the president, Xi Jinping, and Chinas top leaders, who are already grappling with slowing growth.
The countrys cabinet said on Wednesday it planned to spend 250bn yuan ($40.3bn) to foster growth in areas of the economy most in need of support and would accelerate construction of big public services projects.
Beijings interventionist response has also raised questions about its ability to enact market liberalisation steps that are a centrepiece of its economic reform agenda.
China has orchestrated brokerages and fund managers to promise to buy billions of dollars worth of stocks, helped by a state-backed margin finance company that the central bank pledged on Wednesday to provide sufficient liquidity.
The securities regulator said the Securities Finance Corp had provided 260bn yuan ($41.8bn) to 21 brokerages, though that sum is only 40% of the amount of leveraged positions that investors have cut since 18 June.
Unlike other major stock markets, which are dominated by professional money managers, retail investors account for around 85% of China trade, which exacerbates volatility.
Its a stampede, said Wang Feng, the chief executive officer and founder of hedge fund firm Alpha Squared Capital Co and a former Wall Street trader.
And the problem of the market is that all the players move in the same direction, and are too emotional.

Pope Francis drank a tea of coca leaves, camomile and anise seeds on the plane to Bolivia from Ecuador to ward off altitude sickness upon arrival at the highest international airport in the world.
Coca is the main ingredient in cocaine but people in the Andean region have chewed coca leaves or drunk coca tea for centuries for its medicinal properties.
The flight attendant said the pope drank a mix called Trimate containing the three ingredients. It was also offered to journalists on the flight.
The pope did not appear to have any difficulties when he walked off the plane and while he was reading his welcoming address. He is visiting three of the poorest countries in Latin America on a trip that will also include Paraguay.

A Bolivian minister said 10 days ago that Francis had told government officials that he would like to chew coca leaves when he visits. A Vatican spokesman said, however, that the Argentine-born pontiff would decide for himself.
At just over 4,000 metres above sea level, La Paz airport is located in the appropriately named El Alto (the high one), a satellite city perched on the plateau above La Paz.
Indigenous people, including Bolivias first indigenous president, Evo Morales, defend the use of coca and consider it a sacred plant.
For health reasons, the 78-year-old Francis, who lost part of one lung to disease when he was a young man, will be in La Paz  3,650 meters above sea level  for only about four hours before moving on to Santa Cruz, Bolivias largest city, which is at much lower altitude.

Russia is the biggest threat to US national security and America must boost its military presence throughout Europe even as Nato allies face budget challenges and scale back spending, the US air force secretary, Deborah James, said on Wednesday.
I do consider Russia to be the biggest threat, James said in an interview after a series of visits and meetings with US allies across Europe, including Poland.
James said Washington was responding to Russias recent worrisome actions by boosting its presence across Europe , and would continue rotational assignments of F-16 fighter squadrons.
This is no time to in any way signal a lack of resolve in the face of these Russian actions, she said.
James said she was disappointed that only four of Natos 28 members had thus far met the Nato target of spending 2% of gross domestic product on defense.
This is not something that came up out of thin air. This is something that we as NATO members agreed to do. All of us need to be advocates, she said.
The top air force civilian leader acknowledged that Europe was facing difficult immigration and economic challenges at the moment, but said the Nato military alliance and associated commitments should be a clear priority.
Britain on Wednesday said it would commit to the 2% spending pledge for the next five years, which will raise the number of Nato allies meeting the spending goal to five in 2015.
Given the tensions, the air force is continuing its effort to reduce US reliance on Russian RD-180 rocket engines for military and intelligence satellite launches, James said.
She said there were huge demands on US air force assets now, given the tensions with Russia and the fight against Islamic State, but the air force was also working hard to defend its weapons systems and networks against growing cyber attacks.
James said her records were among those involved in a massive breach of personnel records held by the Office of Personnel Management that some US officials have blamed on China. China denies any involvement in hacking US databases.
James said the air force took a hard look at its cyber security immediately after the revelations and decided to redouble its efforts, although no new actions were needed.
She said the service was cataloging weapons and IT systems to detect any possible vulnerabilities, while also working to set up 39 cyber security teams around the country.

Despite what its media machine and PR offensive would have you think, Kazakhstan continues to stand as one of the pre-eminent post-soviet dictatorships, where political opposition and independent media is routinely stifled.
Last week, the remnants of the countrys remaining independent press took another blow. A judge in the countrys largest city, Almaty, found Nakanune.kz , one of the few media voices bucking the state line, guilty of libel .
Citing the outlets corruption investigations into the city of Almatys construction industry , the court found that the outlet has caused undue harm to the industrys financial backers. In addition to the verdict, the court levied a $107,000 fine against the domain name owner, Guzyal Baydalinova.
This is a disturbing shift for a country that enjoyed some semblance of independent, if relatively constrained, media through the first two decades of president Nursultan Nazarbayevs rule. But everything changed following the 2011 Zhanaozen massacre , in which government forces gunned down over a dozen unarmed protesters.
The authorities promptly blamed nefarious outside forces for the protests, and in the four years since the massacre Kazakhstans independent media scene has shrunk from a stable, if small, coterie, to one on life support.
Outlet upon outlet , from newspapers to television, includingRespublika, Vzglyad, Stan TV have disappeared, with authorities citing connections to foreign bogeymen as the reason for their demise.
Outlet upon outlet, from newspapers to television have disappeared, with authorities citing foreign connections
Indeed, Nakanune.kzs closure follows on the heels of this years closure of Adam Bol , an independent weekly castigated for sharing information not vetted by the government in the capital, Astana.
Authorities claimed that an article published by Bol in late August 2014 about the conflict in Ukraine contain[ed] attributes of war propaganda and agitation, violating article 20 of Kazakhstans constitution, which prohibits propagandising for war.
Rights group Freedom House says that although the countrys constitution guarantees freedoms of speech and the press, the government severely restricts them in practice.
In 2014, the group said the Kazakh authorities had inflicted legal restrictions, prohibitive libel and defamation judgments, censorship, and intimidation on journalists and news outlets.
Some international bodies have taken notice, most notably the UN. Between recent criticisms from Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Rapporteur Maina Kiai, who blasted Kazakhstans lack of freedom of expression , the UN has proven one of the few groups willing to call Kazakhstans regime for what it is.

Island of stability?
But the countrys PR machine is determined to show the world a very different picture. State media, lobbyists and politicians have been presenting Kazakhstan as an island of stability in a sea of political chaos.
Its charm offensive even extends to a fully backed world-class cycling team , named after its own capital city, home to big-name riders including last years Tour de France winner Vincenzo Nibali .
With Islamist insurgencies spilling over from Afghanistan, and while Russia and China bully and blunder to the north and the east, Kazakhstan, is portrayed as a place providing freedoms for both citizens and visitors, untainted by the surrounding turmoil.
Kazakhstans officials have even taken to trying to convince western policymakers that the countrys democracy is functioning  despite Nazarbayev now ruling for more than 30 years  and that its religious tolerance stands as a beacon in the Islamic world.
Related: Kazakhstan election avoids question of Nazarbayev successor
But the reality is very different. Kazakhstan remains a nation where an autocrat can comfortably swing 98% of the vote in an election, while political opponents sit in jail , and freedom of assembly remains nearly non-existent.
Even freedom of religion, which the authorities so eagerly play up for foreign observers, is a stretched truth. While the country hosted a Congress of World Religions last month, it remains one of only 33 nations cited by the US Commission on International Religious Freedom monitored for serious religious freedom violations.

There is something of a panic in the west at the moment over fears that it is losing the information war with Russia .
On one level, this may be true. The Kremlin is undoubtedly engaged in a multi-front, multi-message, multimedia campaign to undermine America and Europe .
Everything from the pre-eminence given tin-hatted conspiracy theorists on the English-language state TV channel RT to the infamous troll houses and the efforts to demonise figures such as US State Department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki , testify to this.

But before the west turns to info-warriors of its own, it ought to consider the weaknesses and consequences of the Russian campaign.
It is, primarily, a negative strategy. If anything, opinion polls show dwindling trust in and goodwill towards Russia around the world. Pew Research Center surveys found that between 2013 and 2014 negative views of Russia rose from 54 to 74% in Europe, with the countrys reputation failing to improve in any corner of the globe.
Russias aim, though, is not so much to accumulate its own soft power as to undermine the wests ability to act against it. At that, it has certainly had some success.
Many Nato members are becoming increasingly worried about the risk of being sucked into a wider conflict with the former superpower. At a time when their leaders are talking about the need for a tougher line against Russian expansionism , their electorates are uncomfortable. The sharpest indication of this split is in Germany, where many say they would not want to support a Nato partner facing Russian aggression.
The Russian information war has helped hide the ground truths of Ukraine within a cloud of rumour, innuendo, misinformation and spin. Whatever one may think about the Maidan protests that brought down the former government, the current government in Kiev was elected and is not a neo-fascist junta, as is often suggested
Whatever one may think about the Crimean vote to join Russia , the annexation was illegitimate under international law, and the fact that this continues to be debated attests to the successes of the Russian media campaign.

But lets not assume that all of the innuendo and debate is a product of the Russian info-war, or that the Kremlin is a grandmaster of the memetic chessboard. These debates also reflect an underlying malaise of politics, leadership and legitimacy in the west.
We are willing to doubt the mainstream not because RT exhorts us to question more, as its slogan goes, but because we are already ready to believe that our leaders, our power structures and even our media lie to us.

We find ourselves exposed to conspiracy theories and sensationalist nonsense not because of the Russians so much as our own competitive media environments and the speed with which a funny, compelling or exciting lie or half-truth can be reposted, retweeted and re-reported around the world  outdistancing any fact-checking or sober analysis.
The most powerful counter to lies is not other lies, but the truth
Mark Galeotti
In this climate, the west is simply suffering from its own internal contradictions. The Russians have been able to exploit them but they have also often demonstrated themselves to be counter-productively clumsy.
Those troll farms whose sophistication is often vaunted by western alarmists have become a story in their own right  and anyone wanting to present the Russian perspective in an online forum now runs the risk of being taken for one.
While on the one hand attempts are made to woo German opinion, on the other Russian hackers break into Bundestag computers  probably gaining no more than trivial intelligence but undoing whatever work the media may have done.
In short, neither the Kremlin nor western governments should assume that the info-sphere is a simple battlefield on which disciplined forces wheel and charge. It is, at best, a cacophonous forum where umpteen rival voices struggle to be heard.
Russia may have a megaphone, but this just means that when its message is laughable or offensive it can alienate more people at once.

Now the European Union has launched an East StratCom Team to spread its values within the EU and the so-called eastern neighbourhood countries, including Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, and Russia itself. But an organisation currently struggling to sell itself to sceptical audiences from England to Greece should be cautious about entering into full-blown information warfare.
As soon as such organs are created the temptation is to use them to spin and spread messages that edge closer and closer into outright propaganda. This mistake was made in the early years of the cold war, before the west realised that the most powerful counter to lies is not other lies, but the truth.
Yet the wests weaknesses are also its strengths: a plurality of opinions, an innately sceptical attitude, a willingness to revisit old assumptions. In the short term these may create vulnerability but in the long term they bring resilience.
The infamous declaration by Dmitry Kiselyov, the journalist who heads the state news agency Rossia Segodnya, that objectivity is a myth that is being imposed on us could stand as the motto of Russias information warfare campaign  or perhaps some day as its epitaph.

'Riley the birthday dog' used by North Korea as evidence of western decadence

North Koreas state-run KCTV network has used the popular  birthday dog  meme that swept the internet in 2010 to criticise America and its extravagances.
As seen in a video released on YouTube , KCTVs talk show Todays World used the picture of Riley during a segment about poor conditions in the US.
KCTV commentator Lee Chung-song claimed in the clip that American billionaires are buying $15,000 dog collars for their pets, paying for dog hotels and spas or even hosting expensive birthday parties for their canines, such as the one enjoyed by Riley, while many homeless people are forced to live in boxes, he said.
None of this is untrue, strictly speaking, but it seems the TV channel may have taken the images a little too literally.
Kim Heung-kwang, director of NK Intellectuals Solidarity, said: I have heard of cases where DPRK media producers used the wrong pictures on a movie or newspaper, but this is the first time seeing it on the internet.
Riley went viral in 2010 after his owner posted the picture on her Facebook page. The picture received thousands of views when a family friend republished it Reddit. Riley became known for his smile, which users said looked like the canine was under the influence of marijuana.
The TV clip also shows images of dogs apparently at a tea party, and another surrounded by glasses of champagne, used by the programme as further evidence of Americas deep inequality.
The current affairs programme emphasises the gap between the rich and poor in America  criticising the country for exploiting the human rights agenda against North Korea while failing to shelter its own homeless population.
This incorrectly used image clearly shows the North Korean TV producers hardship in getting the right data file for their show, Kim said.
If the TV producers cant find the data they want to use, it will lead to miscommunication and mistakes, like using the wrong meme, Kim said.
KCTV also used a picture of Giant George , the worlds tallest dog, though his inclusion shows no clear relation to the shows theme on inequality.

How second-hand clothing donations are creating a dilemma for Kenya
Resale of charity shop rejects has destroyed local textile industry but a proposed ban on the importation of used garments risks putting thousands out of work

When a fire razed East Africas biggest second-hand clothes market in Nairobi last week , the deputy president, William Ruto, rushed to the scene to assure traders that the government would do everything to help them to rebuild their destroyed stalls.
But perhaps a more important question Ruto should have answered is whether Gikomba market will be in business a year from now if a proposed ban on the importation of second-hand clothes into east Africa is approved.
In January, east African head of states suggested that Kenya , Uganda and Tanzania should stop importing used clothes in an effort to revive the local textile industry.
Kenya alone imports around 100,000 tonnes of second-hand clothes, shoes and accessories a year  many of which were originally donated to charity shops in the west. According to Oxfam, more than 70% of the clothes donated globally end up in Africa .
The items [charity] shops fail to sell or which they reject are considered for resale elsewhere, says Ian Falkingham, who manages an Oxfam-owned outlet in Senegal, Frip Ethique. Items which are in good condition and suitable for warmer climates are exported to Africa.
According to Oxfam , more than 70% of the clothes donated globally end up in Africa
This second-hand clothes chain sees, for example, a Forever 21 dress once worn by a young woman in London find its way into the wardrobe of a university student in Kenya. University of Oxford sweatshirts, I love London T-shirts, hoodies emblazoned with the star spangled banner or the Union Jack  and even the Confederate flag  are common wear for people who have never set foot in the UK or the United States.
But if the ban goes through, Kenyans will be compelled to buy locally produced clothes, giving textile manufacturers a chance to reclaim the market they lost to cheap imports from abroad.
Death of an industry
The decline of Kenyas textile industry dates back to the early 1980s, when market liberalisation policies spearheaded by the World Bank opened up the local economy to second-hand clothes. Previously, they had been distributed for free among the poor.
But the superior quality and originality of the clothes soon caught the eye of the young urban population, creating a demand that led to the collapse of many of Kenyas once robust textile companies, among them Rift Valley Textiles (Rivertex) and Kisumu Cotton Mills (Kicomi).
According to local media reports , 500,000 people were employed in the textile industry in the 1980s. Today, that number has fallen by more than 96% to around 20,000.
Banning the importation of used clothes is the governments latest effort to save an industry that is all but extinguished  and is intended to try to recover some of those lost jobs.
But, paradoxically, a ban could devastate another group of Kenyans who depend on the second-hand clothes trade to make a living.
William Ngonga, who sells used clothes at Gikomba, is aware of the possible ruling that could destroy the business his family has spent the past two decades building. I am in this business with my parents, I joined them 10 years ago just after finishing university. Its the only work I know, he says.
Ngonga says the business imports an average of two containers of clothes a month, for which they pay 16,700 in tax. The containers are offloaded from ships at the port town of Mombasa from where they are transported by road to Gikomba market.
A glorious, chaotic ecosystem

Gikomba is the ground zero of second-hand clothes in Kenya, and its from here that merchandise is redistributed to retailers all over the country.
Unapologetic for its mess of noise, dust and a confusing maze of timber, iron sheets and cardboard stalls, clothes hang from the stalls in a wild cacophony of colour and design.
If the clothes are not on hangers, they are bundled into giant heaps which the sellers invite buyers to burrow into to find what they are looking for. Often, the best dresses or blouses are buried at the bottom of the pile.
Buyers and sellers jostle for space in the cramped, often muddy, lanes, where the set price of goods is usually so low that it is ridiculous to bargain for anything cheaper. Even so, the more industrious sellers can be heard shouting themselves hoarse, advertising bargains designed to lure even the most reluctant of buyers.
Gikomba pulses with a spirit borne of genuine camaraderie: conversation and laughter punctuate the exchanges between the buyers and sellers.
It is a glorious, chaotic ecosystem that has survived catastrophe after catastrophe, including a terror attack in May last year that killed 12 people and more fires than the traders can count.
Ngonga says he directly employs 15 people, most of whom are casual labourers, and is afraid that they might all be left without a source of income if the East Africa Community goes ahead with the ban.
If these people are deprived of wages, they might turn to crime and contribute to making Nairobi an unsafe city
Charles Kuria
I have a degree in commerce which I have never used, but I might be forced to fall back on it if the ban goes through. I am not particularly excited to have to join the overcrowded job market and become a paper pusher because I really love this job, he says.
And paid employment of another kind is unlikely to match his current earnings: Ngonga reveals that each container imported at 38,574 brings in a profit of over 90%.
Charles Kurias store is one floor above Ngongas. It is bigger, and filled floor to ceiling with bales of clothes.
Kuria has had this store for almost two years, but he has been in the businessmuch longer, starting from the bottom as a hawker selling a few pieces on the streets to a big time wholesaler who now only sells in bales to retailers.
He imports his stock directly from the UK, the US, Canada and Belgium.
Although Kuria is reluctant to discuss his profit margins, he admits to living a comfortable life where money has ceased to be a worry. His is a business that has a sizeable staff, with four people employed permanently and up to 20 casuals each time new stock comes in.
He says the real casualties of a ban would be the casual workers who depend on odd jobs to earn a living.
If these people are deprived of an opportunity to make honest wages, they might turn to crime and contribute to making Nairobi an unsafe city, says Kuria.
Striking a balance
Former Kenya Association of Manufacturers boss Betty Maina is cognisant of the risk that comes with cutting off the second-hand clothes business without a fall back plan for the hundreds of thousands it employs.
In an article for a local media company , Maina says that it is possible to grow the local textile industry without taking jobs from the people who need them the most.
Granted, the mitumba sector is a source of employment and many people earn their livelihood from the business. Measures that would shut down the flourishing trade at a go would not be very welcome.

But why not streamline activities in the sector in such a way that the local textile industry is able to reap the benefits of providing quality products at an affordable price and at the same time providing thousands of jobs directly and millions more in downstream activities? she asks.
The thousands involved in the second hand clothes trade will know their fate once the East Africa leaders meet for the November summit, during which the issue is expected to come up.
In the meantime, it remains to be seen how the government will walk the tightrope of reviving the local textile industry without annihilating Gikomba  and the people that thrive on it.

Nearly 1,400 North Koreans were publicly executed between 2000 and 2013, according to new research, which suggests that the number of these deaths peaked at 160 in 2009. Further increases after 2013 have also been reported.
The Korean Institute for National Unification, funded by the South Korean government, said in its annual white paper on human rights in North Korea that 1,382 executions took place in public in the 13-year period.
The figures, which cannot be independently verified, were said to be based on in-depth interviews with North Korean defectors and confirmed by witnesses in the country. The number of executions carried out away from the public eye is also impossible to ascertain.
North Korean media have reported only two executions in 2014 and none so far this year, according to Cornell Universitys Death Penalty Watch research group. During 2009, only one was officially reported.

But the South Korean newspaper Joongang Daily reported in late 2013 that thousands of North Koreans had been forced to attend executions by firing squad held in stadiums, the first known large-scale public executions under Kim Jong-uns leadership.
Public executions are considered to be a way to keep the population in line. According to witness testimonies from the DPRK, public executions for watching or distributing South Korean films and drug smuggling have increased in recent years, as well sentences for crimes against the regime. Many more are punished by being sent to work-camps, with Amnesty International estimating that 200,000 North Koreans are in prison .
North Korea does not allow access to human rights groups, but an Amnesty report confirms the 2013 spike in executions, claiming that at least 70 death sentences were carried out in the DPRK, from a total of 776 around the world.
Amnesty said the actual number was likely to be far higher, but even without taking this into account North Korea , a country with 0.3% of the worlds people, carries out nearly 10% of its confirmed executions.
This total is still less than Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, which account for 80% of the worlds confirmed executions between them. The US executed 761 people between 2000 and 2013, according to the Death Penalty Information Centre , but many countries, most notably China, refuse to reveal the number of people sentenced to death by the state.
Since 1996, the South Korean unification institute has published annual statistics on executions. This years figures were based on testimonies of 221 North Korean defectors, selected based on demographics and background, of the total 1,396 escapees who came to South Korea last year.

Tehrans Valiasr Street is a long, winding road with sycamore trees and streams that were once fed all year round by the cool waters of the Alborz mountains  when there was enough snow, and when there was enough water. Known as the longest street in the Middle East, Valiasr spans the city from south to north, and reminds you that Tehran is almost surrounded by mountains, like a bird in cupped hands, as fragile and as transitory.
To walk up this street on any given day, from the deep south to the posh north, is to see history etched on walls and windows. Tehran is a city that has much to remember  when it is able.
Scattered along Valiasr, in random corners, one can find some of the citys most ignored treasures: 19th-century Qajar and 20th-century Pahlavi-era homes, with their distinctive architecture of colourful gardens and deep basements. But make sure to look in the most unlikely places.

In south Valiasr, north of Mowlavi Street, behind a large sign for the Sheep Butchers Union, is the house of Anis al-Doleh , favourite wife of the Qajar king, Nasser al-Din Shah. Her story is a real-life rags to riches tale: the orphaned daughter of shepherds, the shah met her on a hunting trip and brought her to Tehran. She gradually rose to become the most prominent wife and raees-e andarooni, executive chief of the harem.
While the house was registered as a national landmark in 2002, it still operates as the headquarters of the sheep butchers union, and this is not necessarily a bad thing. At least it has guaranteed the house a life.

The home is not large, but rosy and welcoming. A round blue pool dominates the garden, reflecting the trees and wall carvings  as well as the hideous three-storey building next door. The first floor is sealed off as storage space. The second (and main) floor houses the offices of the union and they kindly allow me inside. Delicate carvings of flowers and birds in pastel colours fill every room, all juxtaposed to the sound of sheep auction schedules and slaughterhouse prices that men are yelling over the phone.
A high aluminium pyramid roof indicates that once not long ago it snowed heavily in this area. These days one forgets the snow that covered the entire city throughout winter, even a decade ago.
Tehran is not associated with ancient history: popular opinion knows it as the city of the Qajars and Pahlavis. But as recent excavations suggest, Tehran was settled 7,000 years ago. Even so, the Qajar and early Pahlavi eras shaped modern Tehran in giving it a distinct architecture. Divergent art once defined Irans cities: from Qeshm, to Kashan, to Astara, each built according to its locality, climate and artisans. Today, Tehran, like those other cities and more, has been disfigured throughout.
In the Tehran of the most recent centuries, elaborate houses had intricate basements underground, and aab anbar  a deeper basement for water storage. No matter how lavish or simple the home, it almost always treasured a blue pool in the yard around which fruit trees were grown. Windows and doors were wooden, and intricate carvings filled the walls with patterns that became more complex the higher the financial standing of the owner.
Few of these homes remain today, unless renovated by a major organisation. The luckier ones were turned into museums and art houses. Few like the home of Anis al-Doleh were the odd in the bunch that were kept intact but overtaken by random associations.
As recently as the 1930s, Deh-e Vanak in northern Tehran was a farming quarter in the midst of the city. Today, nearby Vanak Square is one of citys most congested areas, but walk towards the village, and you will still find homes built in the 1920s, 1930s and even earlier. Why have they not been turned to apartment buildings in this frenzy? One wonders.
Ali Vanaki comes from a family that has lived in the village for hundreds of years. We were farming in this area for centuries, then Reza Shah came along and gave the entire village to his prime minister, Mirza Hassan Mowstofiyol Mamalek. We refused to leave, but many of these homes do not have proper documents, even to this day.
Despite this, they are still sold for up to 17m tomans (3,500) per square metre in the winding streets, and 30m tomans (6,000) for homes with bigger gardens.
Mowstofiyol Mamaleks grandchildren, in Vanak, remain some of the only old royalty that still live in their grandfathers orchards and Qajar-era home. The house is sealed off with high brick walls, but is available for wedding photographs at staggering sums. From the trees that peek out behind the walls, one can only marvel at the history of this place. Mowstofiyol Mamalek sold part of the village land to the industrialist millionaire Gashtasb Firouzgar, who in turn sold it to Tehran municipality.

Mowstofiyol Mamalek came from a long lineage of landlords and government treasurers, so they were awarded that title a century before his birth.
Today, this piece of land is called Baqh-e Irani (the Iranian garden) and is one of the countrys most exquisite open spaces, covering 3.4 hectares. It is a public park but, as its name suggests, with streams and old orchard trees. Tehran municipality spent a billion tomans on the tulips here alone, says Vanaki.
Much of Tehran was once khooneh baqhi (houses within fruit orchards), of which the remaining trees in Vanak village and Valiasr Street are but small reminders. Across north Tehran where the most luscious orchards once prospered, developers for decades now dry trees to turn their property into land for lucrative high-rises.
According to Tehran municipality law, an orchard cannot be built upon. So, they dry the trees and then request building permits. That is how the history of this city is wiped away: by burning the flesh of trees.
But in many street corners you will occasionally find an old home still in use. Usually, its an elderly couple with children abroad. Once the couple die, the house is sold by the heirs, and the tree drying ensues, followed by an apartment block.

A home in Pasdaran Street next to our high school was inhabited by an elderly couple with four children overseas. Once the couple passed away, it became a 15-storey apartment building. Each of the children made millions, a neighbour angrily remarks, dissatisfied with the heavy traffic the building has brought to the once idyllic corner.
In north Tehran, except for those few homes salvaged for museums, skyrocketing real-estate prices have left almost nothing intact. Adding to the confusion, are homes that were confiscated right after the revolution, taken over by various organisations, passed through the hands of one developer after the next, to the extent that past ownership is nearly untraceable. One might live in a high-rise that can cost as much as 70m tomans (14,000) per square metre, not knowing who used to sleep, sit or read on the very grounds upon which the tower was built.

One of north Tehrans most well-known homes, Baq-e Ferdows or the Mohammadieh palace, now serves as the citys cinema museum. The house was constructed in Shemiran, near Tajrish Square, in the mid-19th century, but underwent changes in ownership and architecture many times before the cultural ministry took the reins following the revolution.
Iranian scholar Mahmoud Afshar bought large areas of land around the orchard, and subsequently donated them for academic pursuits (like the Dehkohda language institute ) which stand to this day. Despite these random reminders, most of what stands of old Tehran must be sought after in downtown and southern areas of the city. The north has been mainly lost.
A rather well-maintained Qajar-era home in downtown Tehran is the house of Qavam ol-Saltaneh, prime minister under both the Qajar and Pahlavi monarchies. Qavams house is Abgineh, the glass and pottery museum, which stands on 7000 square metres of land. Wooden windows, long wooden stairways and delicate carvings adorn a building that served both as Qavams house and office. The museum space inside the house was designed by renowned Austrian architect Hans Hollein.
The care taken with Qavams house is in stark contrast to many other places, including another downtown Qajar-era home, Ettehadiyeh House . To the public, it is known as the home of Dayi-jan (dear uncle) in the popular television adaptation of Iraj Pezeshkzads novel My Uncle Napoleon . The historic house sits in ruins, decaying year after year, while Tehrans Beautification Organisation tries to battle developers who see it as prime real east for a mall. It is located in Lalehzar, in the heart of Tehrans financial district.

What can you expect of a city whose many custodians arent even from the city? said architect and urban planner Kamran Safamanesh in a ceremony to remember old Tehran. His remark hinted that many current-day functionaries rose to prominence with the revolution from villages across Iran , and have no understanding of cities, their histories and stories. A citys memories are a citys identity. Wipe them out and nothing remains, said Safamanesh.
Tehran is certainly not the first city to be overtaken by a development boom. In the last few years, gigantic shopping malls have only meant faster destruction: Palladium, the high-end mall recently opened in north Tehran, sits on grounds of an old orchard that was dried to make way for the mall, built with capital primarily invested by a kebab dynasty known as Raftari.
I remember the orchard, a resident says. Now our neighbourhood has become the parking lot of death. He is selling up and leaving, as the traffic has made it impossible for him to live here anymore, he said.
Although not as old as many others, one of Tehrans most disputed old homes is the house of Ostad (master) Behzad, the prominent 20th-century miniaturist. This is where some of the most well-known artists and intellectuals of the last century Tehran once gathered.

Behzads only son bequeathed the house to the Iranian Heritage Organisation in an agreement that would see the house become a museum. But once the papers were signed, the Heritage Organisation may have forgotten its end of the bargain. Today it serves as a library and storage space for the organisation  somewhere for sleepy, middle-aged ladies in office dress codes to sit around and drink tea with biscuits. The old tiles of the masters work have been removed, even the street upon which the house sits, once called Behzad, has for years now been changed to Nofallah.
The old homes of Tehran are not only reminders of this citys past art, but past co-existence. Haroon Yashayayi is a Jewish-Iranian writer who has spent the last few years writing on his beloved Oudlajan, the once predominantly Jewish neighbourhood near the bazaar.
Oudlajan, along with Sanglaj, Arg, Dowlat, Bazaar and Chaleh Meydan were the neighbourhoods that made Tehran-e Asr-e Nasseri, Tehran during the reign of Nasser al-Din Shah, as the dust was rising from a tired, sleepy city journeying to a new, unfamiliar world.
At the time, with nearly 3000 homes, Oudlajan was known as a prosperous place. Today, walking through the back alleyways you would not know this. The overhead domes have been refurbished but it remains deformed and alienated.
I remember when the street was thriving, when Molook Khanom, a local woman, would walk in the streets and wave hello to everybody, Yashayayi says, in a talk he gave on his upcoming book of stories of Oudlajan, to be published in Tehran. The neighbourhood is home to Tehrans oldest synagogues, sealed off to pedestrians, tourists and wanderers.
Home of prominent Zoroastrians also serve as reminders of the citys past: the house of Arbab Homroz, in east Tehran, was most recently launched as the Iranian National Museum of Graphic Arts. In central Tehrans Chahar Rah-e Valiasr (the intersection of Valiasr and Enqelab Street) a shining monument seems out of place: this is the Qajar-era home of Rostam Giv , the Zoroastrian parliament member and industrialist who also headed the Zoroastrian association until his death in 1980.
During the presidency of Mohammad Khatami, the house was bought by Jahad Daneshgahi, an educational organisation, and renovated by the Heritage Organisation. It is now a fully functional building that serves as classroom space.
Not all standing homes had the same fate. The home of Hassan Pirnia is one of the most significant architectural marvels of the Qajar era but sits in ruins , awaiting a shopping centre on some of its grounds. Some of the carvings at the home have been looted.
Pirnia was a lawmaker, historian and prime minister at the end of the Qajar era. This home is not simply a historic artefact . Within its walls, one of 20th century Irans most significant events took place: the writing of the constitution following the Constitutional Revolution of 1906.
These homes connect the memory of Tehran. Qavam did the writing, Pirnia provided the space. The constitution and the house both suffered the same fate: under rubble. A huge hole was dug for the mall - which has not been built - but permanently damaged the main building.
Emarat-e Masoodiyeh, Masoodiyeh palace, constructed on the orders of Zel-ol-Soltan, son of Nasser al-Din Shah, sits on five hectares of orchards. It has a remarkable facade with incredible carvings, disguising the fact it is crumbling from the inside.
Masoodiyeh palace in Tehran, Iran.
The house has garnered mainstream attention unlike any other in Tehran. In 2014, the Tehran autumn music festival was held there and most recently, the popular band Pallett held a ceremony to release their album on the palaces grounds with nearly 1,000 fans in attendance. They also have a song dedicated to Masoudiyeh in their new album: Tehran, Smile. None of this has quickened the pace of promised renovations inside the home, run jointly by Tehrans Beautification Organisation and the Heritage Organisation.
Tehrans Beautification Organisation, an agency that operates under the municipality, but with its own independent budget, walks on shaky ground. On paper, it is responsible for carrying out artistic projects around the city, and in conjunction with the Heritage Organisation, repairing and maintaining the citys monuments. While it employs sociologists, artists and architects who understand the worth of the citys old treasures, it is under the wings of a far larger body, the municipality, that is leading the charge for high-rises and shopping malls.
It often feels like we have to fight our own limbs, says an artist who works for the organisation. The municipality seems lost between the thirst for more and more real estate, which yields revenue, and the need to save what is left of the very things that give the city character. Some of Tehrans most notorious developers sit on the city council, only exacerbating this dilemma.
But so have we, the residents. Our very existence has mutated the shape and look of this city, from 15,000 residents in Qajar times to more than 8 million today. That the rats of Tehran are almost as big as cats not only speaks to the greed of developers, but how cities have come to be in the 21st century. Mass migration from villages and small towns to cities is the fuel driving ever more apartment buildings , more garbage , more waste, the very thirst for more.
A city without a memory may be a city lost. But what makes Tehrans story flit between the tragic and the uplifting is not just what has been lost but what has been salvaged, repaired, somehow maintained. Part of this citys story is this push and pull, this battle of opposing forces.
Tehran is a city with a past, and there are walls, homes and even people here to still remind you. If you look carefully, beyond the malls, and the butcher shops.

'Fifa must tackle Iran's ban on women watching football'
With the Womens World Cup final ahead, the soccer world must call for an end to the Islamic republics law against women going to stadiums, say prominent human rights activists

As the world watches Sundays Womens World Cup final, TV cameras will capture the joyful faces of spectators of all ages, races, and genders. Such joy, taken for granted by many people around the world, is unfortunately denied to women in Iran.
Since 1982, the Islamic republic has prohibited women from attending football and other sporting events. Though such discrimination is a blatant violation of the statutes and guiding principles of Fifa, it has counted the Islamic republic of Iran football federation as a member for over 30 years without the slightest reproach. The time has come for the world to call on Fifa, and for Fifa to call on Iran, to put an end to discrimination against women.
Barring women from entering football stadiums is a violation of article three of the Fifa statutes, its governing document, which states: Discrimination of any kind against any Country, private person or group of people on account of race, skin colour, ethnic, national or social origin, gender, language, religion, political opinion or any other opinion, wealth, birth or any other status, sexual orientation or any other reason is strictly prohibited and punishable by suspension or expulsion.

Gender-based discrimination also violates Fifas objectives, which are set forth in Article 2 of the statutes, include [promoting the game of football] globally in light of its unifying, educational, cultural and humanitarian values, as well as [controlling] every type of Association Football by taking steps to prevent infringements of the Statutes, regulations or decisions of Fifa. Members of Fifa are required to comply fully with the statutes pursuant to article 13. Articles 14 and 15 provide for the suspension or expulsion of any member that seriously violates the Statutes, regulations or decisions of Fifa.
Iranian women  and men  have taken great risks to draw attention to gender apartheid at sporting events. Offside, a 2006 film by acclaimed director Jafar Panahi , chronicles the poignant struggle of several girls who attempt to sneak into a football match by dressing as men. In 2014, a group of women, including 25-year-old Ghoncheh Ghavami , were arrested for trying to attend a volleyball match in Tehran. Ghavami was sentenced to a year in jail, but released after several months due to an international uproar.
In recent months, the movement has taken on a global dimension. Thousands of Iranian men and women have taken to social media and sporting events around the world, including the 2015 Asian Cup matches in Australia in January, the Iran-Sweden football friendly in Stockholm in March, and the FIVB World League volleyball matches in Los Angeles and Tehran in June, to call for an end to the ban on Iranian women in Iranian stadiums. In February, prominent Iranian activists penned a letter to Fifa president Sepp Blatter. Though Blatter expressed public support for their cause, the situation in Iran remains unchanged.
In tackling gender discrimination, Fifa can take example from its strong position against racism. Fifa has promoted widely its Say No to Racism campaign, including at matches and across various media. Fifas Resolution on the Fight against Racism and Discrimination in its 63rd session of the Fifa congress, held in May 2013, established requirements for competition organizers to formulate concrete action plans to fight racism and deploy anti-discrimination officers in every match, and prescribed a stricter application of sanctions in response to violations.
Instead of expelling the Islamic republic of Iran football federation from Fifa - which would crush the spirit of tens of millions of Iranians - similar anti-gender discrimination rules, regulations, programs and publicity campaigns could provide Fifa and the global community of football fans with more effective tools to enforce and promote Fifa policies and bring an end to discrimination against women in the world of football.
Such strong actions are necessary if Fifa is to remain faithful to its statutes and guiding principles, including its commitment to promote football as a unifying force.
This article was amended to say that the game with Sweden was in March, not May.

North Korea is the best place on the planet  or that is what Hyeonseo Lee believed when she was growing up. It was a rose-tinted vision that faded during the devastating famine that swept through the country in the 1990s.
Hyeonseo became one of thousands of defectors to try to escape across the border to China  a dangerous journey that risks being sent to one of North Koreas infamous prison camps or even death.
Speaking at a Ted talk in 2013, Hyeonseo said she couldnt remember many details of her crossing  apart from the dead bodies floating down the river.
Once she was safely across she went into hiding with her relatives in China before making her way to South Korea , where she now lives and divides her time between her studies and work as a human rights activist.

Eleven years after she left North Korea, Hyeonseo returned to China to help her mother and brother make their own perilous escape .
She wrote of being reunited with her mother in the memoir The Girl With Seven Names: My mind still held the image of her face the night Id last seen her. She was 42 then, and a woman of so much energy she could hardly sit still ... She was far thinner than I remembered, and her mouth was drawn and lined.
Hyeonseo will be talking about her dramatic life story at a Guardian Live event in London from 7-8.30pm (BST) tonight, joined by the Guardians Emma Graham-Harrison , SinoNK s Adam Cathcart and the BBCs John Sweeney .

I have a question for each of the authors regarding their individual stories, if they wouldn't mind talking a little bit about them.
Segun Afolabi: What drew you to the topic of religious revivals and faith healers like Daddy Cool? Did you do any first-hand research on the subject?
Namwali Serpell: I'm so interested in the point-of-view shifts in "The Sack," and how you hold off on revealing the complicated relationship between J. and his bwana until the very end. Could you talk about how you arrived at this structure for the story?
FT Kola: You do such a great job of evoking the awkwardness the Colonel's wife feels at the party, trying to navigate both her husband's excessive pride and her discomfort with her surroundings. I'd love to hear about how you captured such a rich, complicated depiction of her social distress.
Elnathan John: I'm most interested in the resurrections in the story, both for Aunt Keturah in the end, and for Tachio as he considers what his old life must have been like to end up in the refuge home. Could you speak to the connections between Tachio's dream life and the revelations he make from reading the refuge home's records about the histories of the other children?
Masande Ntshanga: One of the things the story foregrounds is the adolescent sexuality of the boys -- developing just as they enter an era in which sex takes on new consequences. What drew you to focusing on young men of this age, and how do their relationships provide a focal point for the larger social changes that the grey man foreshadows?
Thank you all!

Thanks Mr Tibs - I was drawn to the issue of faith healing on several counts including the disappoint of people, post-revival, whose conditions havent improved, and also the tremendous amounts wealth amassed by the pastors who minister to these people - the dichotomy there and the possibility of deep disappointment (or being able to rationalise or even blame oneself because of a lack of faith). And yes, a significant amount of research (but I also go to church from time to time).

Hi Mr Tibs, thank you for taking the time to read our stories and to ask such thoughtful questions! I'm glad the awkwardness comes through in the story - part of my project was to evoke several types of social discomfort and awkwardness, and hopefully to make the reader feel them too.. One type is of course the awkwardness that the greater political situation (occurring in the background) brings about. These are people that are just not comfortable with one another, and they have to talk politely around Apartheid and what it means. But the other is just the very mundane awkwardness of going to a party where you don't know anyone. I wanted the Colonel's wife to be feeling both, and for the two to merge and mingle within her. So part of the writing process for her character was just thinking about all the times I've been to parties and felt awkward, and part of it was imagining the heightened anxiety that engagement between racial groups during Apartheid would cause. For that, I relied on stories from my parents and older relatives. It was then easy to draw the Colonel's wife's focus inwards, into her interior, but of course she simply finds more worries there.
03 July 2015 1:03pm
MrTibs, I'm interested in what you think. Do you find that narrative delay and shifts in perspective are true to life, or distinctly fictional techniques? Do you think they produce a different experience than one would get from interacting with a group of new people? Does time work differently in life, fiction, and dream? Or are they all versions on a continuum?
Guardian contributor
03 July 2015 1:20pm
I was drawn to the age because I wanted to evoke a visceral and physical memory of Bhisho, in which I'd spent some of my childhood years. In writing, I often associate childhood memory with the senses and adult memory with language. I wanted the story to be immersive--to feel more like an experience than a linear narrative.
Their relationships provide a focal point for the larger social changes that the grey man foreshadows insofar as both of them--the group of boys and the country--experience an opening into something unknown: the end of childhood on the one hand, and the end of apartheid--or the shifting of history--on the other.
The link in the narrator's personal discovery of sexuality and the country's re-discovery of the implications and consequences of sex was fortuitous.

In late June 2013, Christopher Catrambone, a garrulous 31-year-old American entrepreneur who had spent almost a decade travelling the world to build a multimillion-dollar company, decided to take a break. Tangiers Group, which Catrambone runs with his Italian wife Regina, provides insurance in conflict zones  to US military subcontractors, NGO workers, journalists and missionaries, among others. The business, rooted in such war-wrecked countries as Iraq and Afghanistan, was flourishing. But that summer, Catrambone decided, the company could take care of itself for three weeks.
Catrambone and Regina, along with Reginas teenage daughter Maria Luisa, set off from their home on the Mediterranean island of Malta , aboard a glistening white 24-metre chartered motor yacht with Burmese teak decking and varnished Tanganyika walnut joinery. As they motored out of Valettas spectacular Grand Harbour  past the Che Guevara 2, a sleek 30-metre super-yacht that belonged to the family of the deposed Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi  a Maltese armed forces veteran, Marco Cauchi, was at the wheel, and an old friend of Catrambones, the Texan chef Simon Templer, was there to cook and have a holiday. I love going out on these yearly cruises with my family, Catrambone said. We cant escape each other and get on our iPhones.
Malta, one of the European Unions most southerly points, was an ideal starting place for a three-week cruise to Tunisia and along the coast of Sicily, not far from Calabria, the southern toe of Italy . This is where Catrambone met Regina nine years ago. He had gone to search for his family roots in the place his great-grandfather left for America in the early 19th century, and ended up living down the road from Reginas mother.

The Guardian spends five days with the Migrants Offshore Aid Station (MOAS) meetings its crew and the migrants it saved
On 7 July, they sailed away from Lampedusa , a small Italian island south-west of Malta that lies even closer to North Africa. A business meeting in Tunisia prevented them staying to see Pope Francis celebrate a mass on the island, devoted to the migrants who made the dangerous crossing to southern Europe from Libya in cheap inflatable motorboats and rickety fishing vessels. Some 500 had drowned en route in 2012 alone. Pope Francis lambasted the rich world for its indifference to other peoples suffering: It doesnt affect us. It doesnt interest us. Its not our business.
As they headed south, Regina spotted a beige winter jacket bobbing in the water. Cauchi, who had once run Maltas maritime search and rescue operations, told her it may have come from a sunken migrant boat. Such tragedies were not new, and only a few months later, the popes warnings would be confirmed yet again, when 380 refugees  many from Syria and Eritrea  drowned over the course of only eight days, most within a quarter-mile of Lampedusa. Migrant deaths became an obsessive topic of conversation on the yacht, and Catrambone, typically, found himself looking for a solution. It makes you think like: Wow! Look at me out here cruising on my boat, at the same time people are out there dying, he said. So our heaven is their hell, right? Our paradise is their hell.
Catrambones business includes, he says, both caring for heroic wounded conflict-zone workers (including multiple amputees) and being part of the financial arm of war. He is coy about his worth, but Bloomberg reports he made his first $10m by the age of 30. His company covers everything from healthcare to emergency evacuations to kidnapping, while Catrambone styles himself a humanitarian, entrepreneur and adventurer. Friends describe him as a compulsive, energetic and tenacious producer of ideas and solutions, who enjoys the drama and challenge of working in some of the worlds toughest spots. A former Roman Catholic altar boy in Lake Charles, Louisiana, Catrambone once considered becoming a priest. Growing up, he tracked natural disasters, coups and the movements of his oil engineer father on a large world map pinned to his bedroom wall. After graduating from a local university, McNeese State, at the age of 20, he was hired and trained by a company that investigated insurance claims. By 26, he had worked as a private eye, a political campaign manager for a Louisiana court official, as an aide in Congress, and as the co-owner of a Cajun riverboat bar serving high-octane bloody marys, jambalaya and gumbo in the US Virgin Islands.

On the yacht, Cauchi  an amiable, stocky, sun-weathered 48-year-old  told Catrambone stories of rescues. Bodies fished out of the sea can haunt you. Martin Xuereb  a former brigadier who had been Cauchis boss as head of Maltas armed services, and would later work with the Catrambones  still recalls watching a body bag being unzipped on a patrol boat several years ago. It was this child, maybe seven or eight, with his fists clenched next to his face and his eyes wide open, he told me. But what could one individual, or one wealthy family, do? Money buys many things, but can it stop people drowning in their hundreds and thousands?
By the end of the cruise, Catrambone had decided to set up his own search and rescue operation. I said: Chris, this cannot be done. This is impossible, Cauchi recalled. But he kept persisting. As Catrambone saw it, he was already in the business of saving lives in conflict zones: I rescue people for money in my other job, he told me. I know what to do. His Tangiers Group is privately owned, making it hard to check his claim that it gives the best medical treatment in the world; he brushed off questions regarding a few old complaints I had found on the internet from employees of US defence contractors about his companys investigative methods, citing confidentiality.
But there is certainly nothing phoney about Catrambones passion for saving migrants. He, too, once lost a home in a natural disaster, when Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans Ninth Ward in 2005, flooding the building beside the St Charles Avenue tram line where both he and Templer lived. (The two men used their compensation money to open the Cajun riverboat bar, but Catrambone still laments the disappearance of the bohemian, racially mixed lifestyle he once enjoyed in his old neighbourhood.)
If you are against saving lives at sea then you are a bigot and you dont even belong in our community
Christopher Catrambone
Catrambone saw the migrants as either desperate, entrepreneurial, or both  not too different from his own great-grandfather. He also knew many of the places they were escaping from. Every major economy has had their hands in Africa , and they have had their hands in the Middle East as well, he told me. Our policies have an equal and opposite reaction. You go in. And now they come in. But Catrambone is not interested in politics or advocacy. For him, the problem is saving lives, based on a simple and typically candid analysis. If you are against saving lives at sea then you are a bigot and you dont even belong in our community. If you allow your neighbour to die in your backyard, then you are responsible for that death.

On a warm afternoon in June 2014, Cauchi steered a 40-metre, steel-hulled boat called Phoenix out of Portsmouth, Virginia, for his first ever Atlantic crossing. Built in 1973 to pull trawler nets off the coast of Canada, it had been chartered as a US military training vessel, but for the previous 18 months it had been laid up and colonised by rats. (Someone had left food in the ships freezers.) The vessel needed a major overhaul, which would be finished off in Malta. Catrambone was on board for the rough crossing: as Atlantic gales stirred up the ocean, the Phoenix proved how tough it was, even surviving a collision with an unidentified object that took a chunk out of its propeller.
Catrambone was determined to start rescuing people in 2014 and had set a hectic repair schedule. It cost a crazy amount of money, said Cauchi. The boat was bought and repaired, for a total of $5.2m, by the Tangiers Group (and still sits on the companys books) but would be operated by a foundation Catrambone named Migrant Offshore Aid Station (Moas) . He hired Martin Xuereb as director in February 2014, after cold calling to invite him for coffee. I am not in the habit of meeting for coffee with someone I dont know, Xuereb, now 47, told me, but he and Catrambone ended up talking for five hours. I wasnt expecting him to be so young. What hits you straight away is his vision, his perseverance and his determination. No volunteers had done anything similar since 1979, when a group of Germans chartered a freighter named Cap Anamur to rescue migrants fleeing Vietnam. An attempt by the same group to rescue 37 people off Italy in 2003 ended with crew members put on trial for facilitating illegal entry into the country; they were found not guilty, and the migrants were deported.

As he attempted to raise funds for Moas, Catrambone found donors sceptical. The Italian navy had launched the Mare Nostrum operation, at a cost of 9m per month, after the October 2013 shipwrecks, to pick up migrants as they left Libyan waters. (Italians are frickin heroes, man, Catrambone told me.) This, at least, made it unlikely that Catrambone would be prosecuted for doing the same. Still, no NGO had become involved at sea, and many European governments complained rescue operations were a pull factor that would increase both migration attempts and deaths. Setting up Moas was not cheap, with monthly operating costs of up to 600,000. Two rigid-hulled inflatable speedboats with twin 70-horsepower engines were bought to ferry migrants to the Phoenix. Catrambone hired an experienced search and rescue crew as well as leasing two helicopter drones and their operators from the Austrian company Schiebel. He was determined to get out to sea, however, and Regina agreed that they could cover the 10-week operation in 2014 with a further $2.3m of their own money.
With Catrambone on board, the Phoenix left on its first mission late in August 2014, heading for international waters close to Libya . The migrant crisis was continuing to intensify. That year, mostly during the migration high season that runs from March to October, 100,000 people squeezed into the overcrowded vessels that pushed off almost daily from the shores of Libya; at least 3,419 died en route.
Moas was planning to act under the instructions of the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) in Rome, which covers the zone crossed by migrant boats from Libya and can order any vessel to undertake a rescue. Given how well suited to the task the Phoenix was, it was inevitable that MRCC would eventually ask it to help. Cauchi was a recognised search and rescue expert, and the Phoenixs 1.2-metre freeboard (the space from the waterline to the open deck) made it a far safer vessel to scramble on to than the lumbering tankers and cargo carriers that sometimes lower long rope ladders to already exhausted migrants, some of whom are pregnant or too young to even walk. A doctor was on board and the vessel was equipped to look after 400 people.

The first call came through after four days, on 30 August. The Moas team quickly found itself involved in the simultaneous rescue of two migrant boats, including a wooden fishing vessel with 350 people  many of them families from Syria  that was slowly sinking. By the end of the rescue, water was flooding onto the main deck of the fishing boat, and many of the migrants were in the sea. So many small children were rescued that the Phoenix almost ran out of baby formula. That was a shock for most of the crew, Catrambone recalled. We were a bit overwhelmed with the thought that this was really happening. These children and mothers were at the hands of the sea, at the hands of death.
The Phoenix rescued 1,462 people in 10 weeks and helped a further 1,500 onto Italian navy vessels. (There were also lulls when the crew fished for bluefin tuna.) The Phoenix operates in international waters that start just 12 nautical miles from the shores of Libya  now one of the worlds most violent places, where two separate governments have only tenuous control over their territories. An American consultant hired to advise on security fretted that the ships unarmed crew was too close to Libyan waters, but Catrambone decided he was overreacting  after long periods working in Iraq and Afghanistan (and a narrow brush with death during a missile strike in Israel), Catrambone felt he knew how to calibrate risk; the success of his own business, he says, is based in part on the tendency of others to exaggerate danger. We are not afraid to go where others are [afraid], he told me. We dont need a military convoy to take us.
You might not get on the Phoenix as a humanitarian, but you are one when you get off
Christopher Catrambone
While Catrambone joined the speedboat crew on rescue missions, Regina and her daughter Maria Luisa helped care for the migrants when they arrived on the Phoenix. One night Maria Luisa found herself talking to a fellow 18-year-old  a cultured, English-speaking Syrian girl named Rasha, who was travelling on her own after both her parents were killed. I looked at her and I looked at me, and I said: What if I was Rasha? What if I had to see people being killed by snipers every day, seeing my parents killed right before my eyes? I would want to leave, she explained. She was so brave. She travels, she gets on a boat. And she says: Either I am going to make it, or I am going to die trying. The more the rescues went on, and the more stories they heard, the deeper the family and crew found themselves bound to the mission. You might not get on the Phoenix as a humanitarian, Catrambone said. But you are one when you get off.
* * *
In October, a few days after their final mission of 2014, I met Catrambone at a small restaurant in Malta. He appeared on a Vespa scooter, looking distinctly unlike a millionaire. (There are expensive cars in his driveway, I later found, but he is still taken to the airport in a tiny old Peugeot 106 by a retired Maltese taxi driver named Charlie.) In the photographs I had seen, Catrambone sported a spivs moustache, though he was starting to add what would become a thick, tightly curled beard. Passionate, single-minded, and slightly unnerved by the press attention Moas had just begun to receive, Catrambone talked up his business but was disarmingly modest. (He says he is the thinker, and I am the doer, Regina told me later. Everything that we have done together has been successful, he added.) He larded his conversation with colourful Louisiana slang, which he then apologised for. He delivered riffs about the millennial generation being tired of huge corporations, excess and greed. He worried that capitalism had lost its soul by eliminating trust. Wealth can be very short-term, he said. We are not trying to be crusaders. Were just being humans, keeping hold of our dignity.
At the time, Catrambone was worried that the pull factor lobbyists had won the argument over European migrant policy. Italy, under pressure from the rest of Europe , had announced the end of Mare Nostrum. Yet the pressures pushing people out of places such as Syria and Eritrea had not disappeared, while Libya remained a perfect operating base for smugglers. When the winter winds settled in the spring, and the sea calmed, migrants would set out once more, he told me; on fine days, that would mean more than a thousand people in numerous boats. The Phoenix, with space for just 400, was set to be the only dedicated rescue vessel.

It took the Mediterraneans worst modern marine disaster, and some 850 deaths, to finally discredit the pull factor theory. On 18 April , as the Catrambones were preparing Phoenix to sail again in May, a large Portuguese cargo boat called the King Jacob was sent to rescue a smaller, steel-hulled cargo vessel carrying up to 900 migrants about 17 miles off Libya. The King Jacob stopped 100 metres from the marooned boat, whose captain  believed to be a Tunisian  manoeuvred clumsily in the dark, ramming the Portuguese boat. The migrant vessel rapidly sank, taking those below decks with it and tipping the rest into the black night sea. Only 28 people survived. The two dozen corpses pulled from the sea were sent to Malta, where on 23 April, the Catrambones sat at an interfaith funeral before rows of dark wooden caskets, and a single white childs coffin marked Body No 132. Within days, a few wilted flowers on an anonymous common grave at the Addolorata cemetery were the only sign that the dead had ever existed.
A few days later, I sat with Catrambone on the quay in Marsa, Malta as the Phoenix was loaded for its first mission of this year. Individual bags of emergency rations and basic clothing were being prepared by their new partners from the Dutch branch of Doctors without Borders , who would care for the migrants on board. One cardboard box was marked body bags. Catrambone was angry about the King Jacob tragedy, but it had shamed Europes politicians and he was hopeful that something was changing. Naval vessels, including the Royal Navys HMS Bulwark, were on their way. He had even heard Jean-Marie Le Pen, the rabidly anti-immigrant founder of Frances Front National, praise the Phoenixs work. Some still disagreed. We will only encourage more and more people to set sail in upturned bath-tubs and patched-up lilos, Rod Liddle wrote in the Spectator a few weeks later. Among them will be maniacal jihadis and assorted criminals, all expecting to be rescued by the countries which, in some cases, they wish to destroy.
Catrambone fretted that Moas was overstretching family resources  both time and money  and, with only 1m pledged, he could not understand why there had been so few donations from rich individuals, especially in the Middle East. It is mostly Muslims who are coming, and there should be help from these rich Arab people that are sitting there, that dont know what to do, he said. But separating politics from rescuing migrants is tough: after announcing they would join the Phoenix this year, Doctors Without Borders in Holland lost some of its donors, who were apparently happy to help mitigate damage from war, famine, or Ebola, but did not want their money spent on rescuing people heading for Europe.
* * *
By the time I stepped on board the Phoenix to join a weeks mission on 14 June, it looked like 2015 was set to be another record-breaking year for Mediterranean migration. We sailed out past the ancient forts overlooking Vallettas Grand Harbour and into a two to three-metre swell that pushed the short, sharp Mediterranean waves above the height of a man. It was hard to imagine any migrant boat daring to launch in such conditions. But several days of bad weather, when the smugglers rest, were coming to an end.
That same evening, as we were heading south towards Africa, Robel Buzuneh and Misgina Tsigay sat in a warehouse, in what they believed was the Libyan navys dockyard in Misrata  a space shared by two smuggling gangs. Like them, most of the 620 people there were Eritreans fleeing a 20-year-old dictatorship known for torture, extrajudicial killings, and forced military service. Buzuneh, a 27-year-old former business student, and Tsigay, 30, were both deserters and, for different reasons, traumatised by the trip. Buzuneh thought he would die in the desert after having been abandoned by his traffickers and running out of food and water. Tsigay had witnessed two of his party, and three Libyan drivers, being shot by an Egyptian border patrol. In the warehouse they ate a monotonous diet of pasta, while men with guns watched over them.
As the Phoenixs reinforced steel bow ploughed through the swell towards the Libyan coast, the Eritreans were shepherded into groups of 50 to 100 and put into motor skiffs that carried them through the dark towards two fishing boats that, to their dismay, were both very old and very small. We did not know the captain and did not know what the boat would be like, Buzuneh said. The Libyans distributed them around the boat, trying to keep it even. Buzuneh ended up stuffed  his knees against his ears  in a space below deck that was just over a metre high.
Further along the coast, Bakory Jobe, a 20-year-old from Gambia, in west Africa, was part of a group of 109 who took turns carrying a large inflatable boat with a Libyan smuggler sat atop, like on a throne. Fifty minutes after setting out from a forest clearing where several hundred sub-Saharan Africans were gathered, they reached the sea and pushed off in the packed rubber vessel, heading for international waters where they expected to be rescued. My legs were trembling and I was praying the whole night, Jobe said.

Both boats yawed and rolled in the swell. In Buzunehs overstuffed fishing boat, people vomited over each other. Heat from bodies packed tightly together and from the engine added to the fear, thirst and claustrophobia. Everyone was very frightened, said Buzuneh. They told us we would be rescued in six hours  After 11 hours we were very scared. With this small boat it is impossible to go for a long period of time, or for a long distance.
The next morning, below deck on the fishing boat, Buzuneh had a small satellite phone thrust into his hands. The smugglers men on the boat had called MRCC Rome, and ordered him, as one of the few English speakers, to transmit their coordinates. Soon a call came through to the Phoenix, directing it to find the boat, which was 30 nautical miles away. Catrambones team had already launched a camcopter drone, which now headed towards the location Buzuneh had specified, and soon the drone was close enough to make out a blue fishing boat packed with people, doing the characteristic drunken zigzag of a small boat struggling to maintain a steady course in a big sea. They just move like ants out there, being pummelled by the waves, Catrambone told me later. With the position and direction of the boat established by the drone, the Phoenix set out to intercept it. Soon a small yellow dot appeared on the radar screen; Cauchi peered through his binoculars to see the blue hull appear on the horizon. The boat sat low in the water, a sign that it was bearing the weight of hundreds of people.
Cauchi directed the rescue operation from the bridge of the Phoenix, which stopped about a mile away from the overladen fishing boat. He ordered the speedboat lowered and it soon sped off with three crewmen, a doctor and a huge sack of life jackets on board. Every time we are sent to an operation, I think sooner or later I will have a heart attack, because you are always thinking what will go wrong, Cauchi said. It needs to be done carefully. The speedboat approached from the back, to prevent people lurching to one side and capsizing their boat.
They were ordered to sit down and to allow the women and children off first. A group of teenage girls, alternately smiling nervously and grimacing with fear, were lowered onto the speedboat. The Phoenixs deep hull acted as a barrier, calming the waves on the lee side, where the girls were pulled aboard. On a second run, smaller children appeared, as young as three, dwarfed by their orange life jackets and clinging to their mothers. A smooth routine followed: the speedboat went back and forth, carrying 15 people at a time. The fishing boat rose slowly in the water as it was emptied, though the upper deck kept filling as the cramped human cargo below deck crept out of the narrow, square hatches.

I joined the speedboat crew as they bumped across the open sea to pick up another group of migrants. When I clambered onto the fishing boat after the last men left, it occurred to me that an armed smuggler might be hiding below deck, waiting to sail the boat back to Libya. But nobody was there. (Catrambone later told me he had once experienced the same sensation, and ended up hollering through the hatch, telling anyone still there to come out or face his wrath.) Water was pooling beside the still-throbbing Hyundai engine. Both decks were a mess of water bottles, discarded scarves and shoes, half-eaten packs of cheese triangles and little drawstring bags with pictures of Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo. Plastic bags and other rubbish floated around the stinking lower deck. A small plastic bag can easily block the pump. If the bilge pump stops, you are done, said Cauchi. The smugglers had also put in new unpainted wooden struts to ensure the upper deck did not give way under the weight of 150 people. Empty boats are valuable, and during a recent rescue, three Tunisian fishing boats approached while Catrambone was helping get the last men off. They were signalling for us to come over and talk, Catrambone recalled. Our thought was that either they wanted to kidnap us or take the boat. Its better not to talk to them.
Back on the Phoenix, one girl, her trousers covered in vomit, collapsed as soon as she got on board. Mostly there was quiet relief as energy snacks, water bottles, blue towels, woollen socks and thin white, wind-blocking protective overalls were handed out. After a few minutes of stunned silence the small children, miraculously, began playing.
* * *
Later in the day, when 106 survivors from Jobes inflatable boat were transferred onto the Phoenix from a rescue boat chartered by the Belgian branch of Doctors Without Borders, it became clear how successful our first rescue had been. On Jobes boat, which had called the MRCC on a satellite phone that morning, the rescue effort had gone badly wrong: three people drowned at the last moment, and as air leaked out of the inflatable boat, he had watched a panic break out as five or six people fought to grab the rope ladder lowered to them. Unable to swim, he decided to sit still, but more than a dozen people fell into the sea. Another Gambian, Abubacarr Gibba, aged 27, fought to get onto the ladder, fell in the water, climbed out and then fell back in. I cant swim. I always said I was like a big stone, he said. But the sea refused to drag him down and when he broke surface a second time and began vomiting gasoline-tanged sea water, a friend urged him to reach a life jacket that had been hurled into the water. I managed to swim, which I had never done in my whole life. The inflatable boat, he thought, would not have lasted another hour.
For the next 48 hours, a small sample of 21st-century African migrants to Europe  with the addition of a few Bangladeshis  lived squashed together on the Phoenixs two outside stern decks, telling their stories. For some, the sea had been a minor hardship compared to what happened before. Libya is hell for black people, said Jobe, who still had wounds on his knee from a beating. On his first day in Libya, 40 of his group were kidnapped by armed men who robbed them. They shot a friend in the leg, he said. Buzuneh and the other Eritreans had each paid $4,000 to travel via Khartoum, in Sudan. I didnt think it would be this difficult, he said. People think Europe is heaven.

The teenage girls remained quiet about their ordeal. Jobe knew why. Every night Libyans come with their guns and take three or four of our women, he said. If you cry he will beat you. Then maybe after he will give you one packet of biscuits. On deck a couple of teenage girls  no older than 15  saw Maria Luisa as a confidant. Men not good, one explained, pointing at her own body. After two summers of regular missions and taking professional seafarers exams, Maria Luisa has matured beyond her years and learned to hide her own horror at the stories she hears. Sometimes it is too overwhelming, and you just want to say: I cant believe they are really doing this to you. But you cant say this because they need to talk, and they need to be heard.
The Phoenixs upper deck was packed. Men trod on each other, argued briefly over the tiny spaces available to stretch out, and continued to vomit. Mostly, though, they slept, ate the freeze-dried Adventure Food vegetable hotpot that had been heated up with boiling water, and wondered about the future. I dont know what will happen tomorrow, said Gibba But we think we will feel safe in Europe. Some wanted to go to Britain, because they knew the language. It will be easier, because we in Gambia were colonised by England, reasoned one man with a brother in Leicester. Others wanted to go to Germany, or Switzerland, or simply did not care.
After the second night, they awoke to see the low coastline of Sicily before the Phoenix entered the harbour at Augusta. A dizzying array of Italian organisations waited on a cargo dock beside a mountain of scrap metal. The migrants stepped down the gangplank to touch European soil and walked on to a tented processing camp with doctors, fold-out beds, food and tents proudly bearing the name of Italys Ministero DellInterno. UNHCR officials were ready to help process asylum petitions, which Eritreans can expect to have accepted. They were moved on to permanent camps by the morning, though many flee these immediately, knowing that EU rules mean that if they were to be fingerprinted by Italian police, other European countries could send them back there. Further along the coast, Eithne, an Irish naval service patrol boat, was delivering a similar number of people. Another thousand migrants had made it to Europe in a single, not very remarkable, day.
* * *
We sailed back to Malta through rough sea, the white-tops occasionally dumping their froth on the deck, while Cauchi stared out of a window and marvelled at how stable the boat remained. By the time we docked in Malta again, the European Union had adopted a more aggressive stance, agreeing to establish a 12m military operation to sink boats used by smugglers. Catrambone likens military and law enforcement attempts to stop migration to the war on drugs. The problem will not go away, he says, until there are no users. It just dont look like theres any fricking chance of any alternative happening right now, he said. There is no easy answer. That is why I am saying you really have to focus in on saving peoples lives first.
Catrambone says he would close Moass Mediterranean operation if Europe had something better to offer, but that does not seem likely to happen soon. He once told me that he could have replaced the whole Mare Nostrum operation with something similar for a third of the cost, and he continues to think in ever bigger terms. He would like to have $10m a year to charter a new boat, a 45-knot Australian-built catamaran ferry named HSV-2 Swift, which is two and half times the size of the Phoenix. It could make the trip from the rescue zone to Sicily in just five or six hours. That may seem fantastical - but it is no more so than the idea of MOAS seemed less than a year ago. Catrambone did not rule out the possibility that Moas would operate elsewhere  a similar migrant tragedy, after all, is occurring off Myanmar, as the Muslim Rohingya minority flees persecution.
Related: Europes worsening migrant crisis  the Guardian briefing
All that will require more money. While we were out at sea, a fundraising drive by the activist organisation Avaaz reached $500,000, slightly less than a months costs. Moas will now just about cover running costs from donations this year, though the Catrambones continue to plug holes. Catrambone knows one of his problems is that, unlike many other wealthy individuals, he is at the action end of the philanthropy chain. Most set up foundations to finance political advocacy or donate to existing NGOs, many of which have large memberships. He and Regina are wary of Moas being seen as an eccentric millionaires hobby, making it harder to raise money and awareness. We are not bored, we are not old, we have a lot to do, said Regina, who has increasingly turned her attention away from their business and towards Moas. And with a large, well-organised NGO like Doctors without Borders sending its own boats this year, there is now an element of competition for raising funds. Cooperation, Catrambone says, is the future. Catrambone has also thought of seeking funding from the merchant marine industry, which loses money every time a cargo vessel or oil tanker is ordered to a rescue.
Whatever the future holds, nothing can change the fact that the Catrambones  initially self-financed, freelance operators  have set both a precedent and, having never lost a life, a standard. Those who care about migrants drowning, Catrambone insists, no longer have to wait for governments to act. They can turn, instead, to Moas or other NGOs. He had already told me that if the family business ever went down, he and Regina would have no regrets about spending so much time and money on Moas. A lot of people say: Oh, look at the millionaires! Theyve spent a lot of money, he said. Ive invested my life into this and my family has invested our savings. This is important for us and we believe in it. And you know what, if I am poor one day and Im out in the street, well so be it. But we did this. And we are proud of it. I will never take anything back.

A leading member of the Ulster Defence Association has been murdered in south Belfast on Wednesday night.
The victim has been named locally as Colin Bap Lindsay who died after being stabbed at a house in Kirkistown Walk on the loyalist Belvoir estate in the south of the city.
Another man is in a critical condition in hospital following the assault which followed an all-day drinking session at the property.
The Police Service of Northern Ireland said on Wednesday night that one man has been arrested.
Loyalist sources in south Belfast told the Guardian that Lindsay had been stabbed with a cutlass-like sword. It is understood the arrested man gave himself up after returning to his own home covered in blood and informing a member of his family that he had stabbed the UDA commander in the area.
There is no suggestion the fatal attack on the veteran UDA man is linked to any internal feuding within the organisation or was sectarian, sources close to the loyalist paramilitary group stressed. They said the incident was due to a dispute that had been broken out after drinking in the area.
Lindsay was originally from the Ballynafeigh area of south Belfast but moved out to the outskirts of the city to Belvoir. He was a close associate of UDA veterans Joe Bratty and Raymond Elder who were shot dead by the IRA just before republicans declared a 1994 ceasefire.

Back to normal transmission. The inquiry is hearing that work cover premiums for Chiquita Mushrooms went from $1.2m at time of the last EBA to $6.2m at time of subsequent negotiations.
03:36
Shorten has perked up with the mushrooms.
What was happening is that you have pickers in their mushroom sheds. I dont know if you want me to just briefly describe a mushroom shed? It just goes to the relevant ...
There is laughter in the hearing room for the first time in a day and a half.
Shorten takes that as his cue and ploughs on.
There are six trays of mushrooms, sort of like a greenhouse sheds ...
Shorten wants to expand. Stoljar says sure, go ahead.
Bill Shorten:
You talk about conflict of interest. I want to go to the general principle and a couple of the specifics youve said. Why is it some people assume that negotiating with a union in terms of improving the unions ability to deliver services that there is a conflict of interest?
The truth of the matter is I dont start my negotiations with a company assuming that we have diverse irreconcilable differences. My interest is in making sure members do well.
He says Stoljars characterisation of the agreements being secretive is not right.
Nothings secret, its all in the books. You make the point its untoward. Im not saying I or members used to go to the ledgers, but its listed in the ledgers as paid education income.
Its not what it isnt, its exactly what it is.
(Im not sure what Shorten means by this. I suspect he means its in the books, not hidden  but I confess Im not 100% sure.)
Stoljar yanks his head out of the weeds. Does Shorten believe that when it comes to enterprise bargaining, his job is to go in as hard as he can for the members?
Bill Shorten:
Always have, always will.
Q: And your position is fundamentally weakened if at the same time youre negotiating a secret deal whereby $500,000 gets paid direct to the union, do you agree with that?
Not at all. I dont agree with your characterisation over the past minute and a half.
03:22
Stoljar is suggesting now that the ledgers in the AWU accounts are somewhat opaque for a glass worker. Shorten insisting the information is in the ledgers. Stoljar isnt disagreeing with the broad point. Hes now querying the figures in the ledgers. Stoljar wonders if the AWUs income from education went into consolidated revenue and was expended by the union however it saw fit.
Shorten said while he was at the AWU he diversified the unions income streams so it could focus on education and training.
Was it Mr Gillhome from ACI? Stoljar wonders who was the party to the oral agreement at ACI.
Shorten:
Yes, I thought Id answered that.
Stoljar wants to know whether the parties considered recording it in the EBA? Shorten says these arrangements were part of the common claims the AWU were making at that time. Counsel assisting repeats his earlier question: how exactly would the members find out about it if it wasnt in the EBA?
Shorten says the levy amounted to 10 cents per member per hour worked. He says the AWU had a known commitment to paid education, and the specifics were in the AWUs annual accounts.
Stoljar has just cracked open the AWU accounts. He suggests it would be pretty hard for a glass worker at the Spotswood plant to get the detail from the AWU accounts, given paid education is represented simply as a line item of income.
Shorten says there are supporting documents. What supporting documents, Stoljar wonders? Ledgers, Shorten says.
03:00
Stoljar is back on invoices. We are still with ACI Glass. Stoljar is confused why ACI GLass is paying the union amounts adding up to about $500,000 without any legal obligation to do so.
Wheres the contract, Stoljar wonders? I dont know, says Shorten, it was possibly an oral agreement. Who were the parties to the oral agreement, Stoljar wonders?
Shorten:
ACI and the union.
To the extent that I recall it would have been Mr Melhem, supported by myself.
Stoljar says so you were a party to it then? Shorten says in general terms. He didnt know about specifics. Not ins and outs.
02:54
My kingdom for this transcript.

Lets keep calm and carry on.
02:52
Ill wait for the proper lunch break to post an explanatory summary but in case you are a bit lost in the weeds of this mornings evidence, heres the short version.
Stoljars line of questioning is aiming to establish the impropriety of side deals the AWU did with various employers. The AWU had a practice of billing employers for services the union provided, like training, or ads in the union journals, or in the last EBA, education services.
Stoljar is attempting to establish Shortens knowledge of the various agreements, like one with Thiess John Holland, and ACI Glass. Having established knowledge, he moves to the conflict of interest point. Do the workers know about these deals? Do the workers benefit from them, or does the union benefit?
Thats it, in a nutshell.
And here they are, back.
02:42
Daniel Hurst
As the commission takes a very short recess, I can post this contribution from Daniel Hurst, who is hunkered down in the hearing room. Ive asked him to send me the odd update about dynamics and atmospherics in the hearing room.

Bill Shorten has appears to have taken on a more sombre mood in answering questions after the commissioner, Dyson Heydon, warned him twice against giving lengthy answers. The Labor leader seemed relatively chipper in the first hour of questioning today, appearing to be firm in his belief that the enterprise agreement with Thiess John Holland for the East Link road project was a good deal for workers. He said he didnt recall specific amounts of payments from the joint venture builder to the AWU being discussed during negotiations - and seemed frustrated when counsel assisting Jeremy Stoljar insisted on direct yes or no answers.
Heydons first intervention (for which the whole room was silent) obviously influenced Shortens subsequent answering style. A couple of time, Shorten seemed like he wanted to say more but he specifically referenced how he was mindful of the commissioners suggestion.
When Shorten said he wanted to explain the chronology of paid education leave, the commissioner warned him it would be at your peril if it turned out to be irrelevant. Shorten grinned and told the hearing: Ill take your gentle guidance and wait,
There are fewer observers in the public gallery today than there were yesterday for Shortens first day of questioning. Like yesterday, former ACTU leader and cabinet minister Greg Combet is quietly watching the evidence while sitting with Shortens legal team at the desk.
02:38
Shorten says the agreement at ACI Glass was Cesar Melhems primary responsibility, reporting to him. He confirms the main negotiator at ACI was a Mr Gillhome. Shorten confirms Mr Gillhome was someone he knew well.
Stoljar wants to know if he spoke at Mr Gillhomes farewell party? Shorten cant remember. Its possible.
We are heading back to paid education leave. Stoljar wants to know whether Shorten spoke to Gillhome about paid education leave and the concept of paying an employer levy. Quite possibly, he thinks.
Stoljar is asking about an AWU invoice worth $79,750 made out to Gillhome. What did he know about it? Shorten says Cesar Melhem would have said something to him along the following lines: Good news Bill, weve got a company willing to back your concept of an education levy.
Stoljar says theres a second invoice. But he says paid education leave is not reflected specifically in the ACI enterprise agreement. Whats going on there?
Shorten says he wasnt involved in the clause by clause negotiation.
Stoljar wants to know why the company is paying the AWU this money if paid education leave is not reflected in their workplace agreement. And did the members know they had an entitlement if it wasnt reflected in their agreement?
Bill Shorten:
I believe theres a number of ways members would have known.
Stoljar is back to conflict of interest and side deals.
Do you accept this is a conflict of interest?
Shorten:
02:22
Stoljar is moving on to ACI Glass  another enterprise agreement.
Shorten thinks he might like to track back to a discussion a couple of moments ago about paid education leave. Commissioner Heydon suggests to Shorten that may not be in his interests at this point in time. Shorten says he will move on.
02:16
Stoljar wants to know whether the CFMEU had a comparable agreement to the AWUs agreement with the joint venture. Shorten doesnt know.
Stoljar asks Shorten whether he accepts that he has to work in the best interest of employees and whether a side deal involving payments to the union would be a serious conflict of interest?
Shorten says he knows the AWU was supplying specific services to the project. This was normal practice, he says.
Stoljar says why wasnt the arrangement in the EBA? Arent EBAs catch all agreements? Shorten says not always.
Stoljar asks whether Shorten had a pattern of seeking contributions from employers negotiating EBAs  contributions directly to the AWU?
Shorten says the union routinely sought contributions for training, or for ads in the journals and for education on site.
Stoljar is persisting on Shortens specific knowledge of the agreement with the AWU.
I would not have just said that the company should just pay the union.
Stoljar:
Are you evading my question?
Commissioner Heydon then chides Shorten for being non-responsive. He says Shorten is here at the royal commission to rebut some of the criticism that has been made about him in recent weeks. Heydon says hes concerned about his credibility as a witness, and his self-interest. He says its in Shortens interest to curb his extraneous answers. Heydon says it is partly Shortens fault that we are proceeding slowly through the material. He says you are here to clear this up, so please proceed.
So chided, Stoljar asks the question again.
Shorten says I would have had discussions about the EBA and about how the AWU would organise after the EBA to deliver services at the site.
Stoljar asks is it a coincidence that the joint venture then started paying the amounts up to $100,000 to the AWU?
Shorten:
01:59
"I don't remember that"
Stoljar wants to know whether Shorten spoke to Mr Rzesniowiecki (I will need to check this spelling when possible) or Mr Sasse about Thiess paying in instalments. Shorten acknowledges in general terms he spoke about matters pertaining to the agreement.
Stoljar moves on to the provision of red card training. Shorten says this was a legitimate purpose provided. Stoljar points to company correspondence saying John Holland ran red card training on the project (meaning the AWU didnt have to provide the service because it was already being delivered by the employers.)
Shorten says the company didnt have to pay for things like ads in the union journal, or a ball for the workers, but it did it to build good relations with the union and the workers.
The Labor leader then repeats his earlier formulations. He didnt have a line of sight on all these invoices. But the relationships underpinning the invoices are actually the important thing to understand from his perspective.
Stoljar goes back to Mr Sasse and other joint venture executives. Did he have discussions about the agreement to pay the AWU $100,000 in instalments?
Shorten:
I dont remember that.
Stoljar repeats the question.
I dont particularly remember having discussions on what youve just put to me.
Updated
01:46
Stoljar is persisting with the invoices. He says they suggest that Thiess was making good payments up to the amount previously agreed with the AWU. Stoljar quotes joint venture correspondence stating if we dont reach the agreed sum we can address at the end of the year.
Jeremy Stoljar:
Its clear that what they are talking about is getting it up to $110, 000.
Shorten goes back to the agreement with the joint venture. He says his expectation is if AWU invoices went out it was for services provided. He says the East Link project saw value in the agreement with the AWU.

Shortens point is Stoljars questions should be directed to Cesar Melhem, then secretary of the Victorian branch.
I was not administering the day to day matters of the Victorian branch.
Stoljar says hang on, werent you meeting with him regularly? Shorten says he was, but he wasnt on site. His contact with Melhem was about national matters.
Shorten continues.
I cannot speak to invoices specifically issued after my time.
He says he cant speak to invoices from the Victorian branch. He didnt have a line of sight on those invoices. I didnt inspect every invoice that went out.
Shorten repeats that he would not agree to employers paying the union for services that werent delivered.
01:31
Stoljar is moving on to advertising in the AWUs journal, the Australian Worker magazine. Stoljar wants to know why the Victorian branch is charging for advertising when the national office actually produces the publication. Shorten says that shouldnt have happened.
Stoljar says invoices were being issued to make up the $100,000 payments per year under the agreement with the East Link joint venture  with no regard to whether or not the services were actually provided.
Bill Shorten:
Stoljar is asking about an invoice for HSR training of $38,750. What is Shortens knowledge of this? Counsel wants a yes or no answer.
Shorten isnt inclined to give him one.
Mr Stoljar, in the interests of getting to the bottom of matters, some answers take longer than one word.
01:22
Stoljar is asking whether the joint venture agreed to pay the AWU $100,000 a year for the life of the agreement.
Bill Shorten keeps defaulting to the substance of the enterprise agreement between the AWU and the East Link joint venture. He says he was determined to strike the best deal possible, and get the best job security possible. Then we get to site organisation. Shorten says it is quite usual for companies to pay for various services on site.
Stoljar repeats the question. Was there an agreement to pay $100,000 a year?
Shorten says that is not his recollection. He says the services the union provided while he was at the AWU could always be explained by training delivered.
Bill Shorten:
01:14
Daniel Hurst
Just for clarity, the $300,000 is total payments from Thiess John Holland to AWU Victoria and the national office between 2005 and 2008.

Shorten begins his evidence
Counsel assisting Jeremy Stoljar is opening his line of questioning on the joint venture between Thiess and John Holland. This is the East Link project. A bundle of documents has just been dropped.
Stoljar is asking Shorten about a $300,000 payment to the AWU in Victoria. Stoljar is asking whether the AWU in Victoria did research into back strain in the period leading up to 18 January 2006. The witness doesnt recall this specific piece of work.
Shorten notes back strain is a big issue in civil construction. Stoljar doesnt doubt it but he wants to know about these specific invoices.
Q: Is this a bogus invoice claiming for work never done?
Bill Shorten:
00:57
Having worked through the substance of yesterday, and shared various reflections on it, just a thought about tactics before we blast into rapid fire element of the day.
Shortens approach to the commission has been to play the whole process in a low key fashion, cooperating with the Stoljar questioning, biting back only when provoked and then in low key fashion.
Outside the commission, Labor has been attacking the process as stacked against the opposition, a witch-hunt and all the rest. One option Shorten would have is to bring some of that critique inside the proceedings today rather than maintaining the current separation between the way hes presenting and the political attack going on outside.
Its a more risky way to go, and I make no predictions about it whatsoever. Im just noting there are different ways you could approach the proceedings.
Underway in a minute now. Refresh your beverages.

Let me point you in the direction of a couple of good analytical pieces besides the one posted by Gay Alcorn covering Wednesdays hearing.
The gentleman of Australian political journalism, Age political editor Michael Gordon, says Bill Shorten held up well in the morning onslaught but the exhausting nature of the grilling took its toll in the afternoon. Gordon also highlights an almost surreal edge to the #turc inquisition  a process set up by a Coalition government (who deregulated the industrial relations system and campaigned against union militancy) now taking a moderate union official to task.
The more substantial question is whether Mr Shorten acted in the best interests of his members when he led the Australian Workers Union and, while it is premature to draw conclusions, there is an almost surreal edge to this inquisition. Here is the party that wanted to abolish the no-disadvantage test for enterprise agreements taking Mr Shorten to task for allegedly failing to uphold it in one instance.
John Lyons at the Australian notes that whether or not the royal commission is a witch-hunt, it remains Shortens big test. Lyons thinks the Unibuilt donation knocked Shorten about in the witness box.
[Shortens] former ministerial colleague Greg Combet looked on anxiously as an often defensive Shorten sought to explain away the many unsavoury elements of the Unibilt deal. Was it not a breathtaking conflict of interest that Unibilt was paying for Shortens campaign director at a time when Unibilt was about to begin negotiations with the AWU for a new enterprise bargaining agreement? Cue a nervous reach for a glass of water, before Shorten admitted that he had not initially revealed this donation-in-kind in his declaration to the Australian Electoral Commission, only rectifying this days before he was about to appear before the commission.
It was the most damaging moment for Shorten in what was a day-long, bruising battle with Stoljar.

Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of Bill Shortens second day in the witness box at the trade union royal commission. Shorten is giving evidence about the period he was secretary of the Australian Workers Union Victorian branch  from 1998 to 2006. Shorten also served as the unions national secretary from 2001 until he entered federal parliament in 2007.
Before we launch into #turc day two, lets recap the highlights from day one.

The Labor leader, under questioning from counsel assisting the royal commission, Jeremy Stoljar, told the commission on Wednesday a labour hire firm  Unibuilt  had paid for a Young Labor activist, Lance Wilson, to run his 2007 campaign for Maribynong.
The donation was only disclosed to the Australian Electoral Commission on 6 July  two days before Shortens appearance at the royal commission, and eight years after the fact. Sadly, Bill Shorten is not the only Australian politician to be tripped up by incomplete donation disclosures. Shortens undisclosed donation is certainly not a good look, but because Australias disclosure regime is only half serious, this sort of tardiness is relatively common.
The donation came at a time when the AWU was negotiating an enterprise agreement with Unibuilt. Shorten said he didnt believe Unibuilt was seeking something in return for the donation, and he said he was capable of separating his personal interests as a would-be member of parliament from his obligations as a trade union official to safeguard the interests of workers. Shorten told the commission this is how Australian politics works  youve got to use your network to fundraise and seek in-kind contributions  everybody does it.
Stoljar moved on in the afternoon to a workplace agreement the AWU struck with Cleanevent in 2006. Stoljar was very interested in clauses of the agreement that seemed to pay casual cleaners below award rates. He wondered how this agreement could have passed the industrial laws no-disadvantage test  the one that makes sure workers cant be made worse off. He pointed to a statutory declaration from the AWU to the industrial relations commission which didnt highlight the discrepancies in the casual rates. Shorten said he relied on advice from the relevant AWU industrial officer and a positive vote from the Cleanevent workers in reaching an opinion that the agreement was beneficial for the workers.
So that was Wednesday in the witness box. A couple of additional resources to help you prepare for today.
If you need to walk back a couple of steps from the specifics of Wednesday, and read up on what this inquisition is all about, you can find a very useful primer by my colleague Daniel Hurst here . Still in primer territory, I linked to this yesterday and will again today. Our colleagues at Fairfax have produced a list of questions Shorten needs to answer.
If you would like to try and decode Wednesday a little further and contemplate some bigger systemic issues about fundraising and political culture highlighted by Shortens testimony at the royal commission, another colleague, Gay Alcorn, has written a terrific analysis which you can find here .
If youd just like some comic relief, you can find First Dog on The Moons depiction of the opposition leader, Stiff Breezington, in the #turc witness box, here .
Shorten is due to take the stand at 10am.
Well continue to read in gently until he appears. The Politics Live comments thread is now open for your business, and you can find me, today, and most days, and some evenings and weekends, depending on how much my family wants to talk to me, on the Twits @murpharoo
Buckle in young #turcs. Here comes B-Day 2.0

In a statement from Havana, where the talks have been held for the past two and a half years, the Farc rebels said the truce would start on 20 July  Colombian independence day  and last for a month.
That will bring respite to Colombians who have suffered the effects of a recent spate of rebel sabotage on infrastructure that has caused massive oil spills and toppled energy pylons, leaving hundreds of thousands without clean water and electricity.
With this, we seek to generate favourable conditions to advance with our counterpart to work toward a definitive, bilateral ceasefire, said the Farc leader Ivn Mrquez.
President Juan Manuel Santos said he valued the gesture from the Farc, but warned it was not enough.
If the ceasefire were accompanied by concrete commitments on the subject of justice and a definitive ceasefire, then we would be talking about progress, he said at a public event.
A previous unilateral ceasefire called in December, which was meant to be indefinite, was reciprocated by the government with a halt to air raids on rebel camps. But the detente ended after the Farc ambushed and killed 10 soldiers in April and Colombias military resumed bombings, killing more than 20 guerrillas during a raid in May.
According to the Conflict Analysis Resource Centre (Cerac), a Bogot thinktank, June was the most violent month since the peace talks started in November 2012 with 24 attacks on police and military posts, 17 attacks on roads, pipelines and electric towers and four ambushes.
The announcement of the ceasefire came just days after the chief government negotiator, Humberto de la Calle, warned in a newspaper interview that the peace process was at its lowest point since it started and that the government side was prepared to walk away.
The harsh truth is that Colombians dont believe in the peace process, De la Calle said.
Related: Colombia: is the end in sight to the worlds longest war?
A Gallup poll released last week showed Colombians evenly split between those who favour a negotiated solution to the countrys 50-year-old conflict and a military one. Support for Santos, who has made the peace process a cornerstone of his two-term presidency, was barely 28%.
On Tuesday, four countries sponsoring the Colombian peace talks called for an  urgent de-escalation of violence to try to avert a meltdown in the talks.
This is a bold first step by the Farc to ease tensions and toward a bilateral ceasefire, said Christian Voelkel, researcher for the International Crisis Group.
However, a bilateral ceasefire will probably only be possible once there is an agreement on the transitional justice framework for demobilised combatants. The Farc have said they will not accept jail terms in exchange for signing a peace deal but polls show a vast majority of Colombians  82% according to Gallup  want to see demobilised rebels serve prison sentences before they are admitted back into civil society.
That is one of the stickier issues the two sides have been negotiating in Havana, after reaching agreements on three of the six points on the agenda. Santos has hinted that an announcement on reparations to victims could be made soon and could help restore some public faith in the negotiations, said Voelkel.
The new Farc ceasefire prepares the ground for such an announcement, he said. Whether that happens in day weeks or months, we dont know.

Pity is a strange thing. Tragedy in classical theory is supposed to inspire both pity and terror, but the daily horror and violence ofworld news often leave us struggling to produce those responses. While we might, in principle, be shocked by James Joyces irritating character Stephen Dedalus when he says in APortrait of the Artist as a Young Man that a death in a road accident cannot be truly tragic because it is remote from terror and pity according to the terms of my definitions, the reality isthat no one can really feel on cue theemotions apparently required of us by a daily news stream of anniversaries of bombings and economies on the brink. But a hippo being shot with atranquiliser dart in a flooded city street is another matter entirely.
Related: The tragedy of Tbilisi zoo  what happened next?
Who would not be upset by the strange spectacle of a hippopotamus, suddenly freed from its zoo enclosure by torrents of water, wandering dumbly and innocently through a new world of streets and floating cars, nibbling at the leaves above, until it was cornered and a pink dart was fired into in its lumbering body?
The pathos of Tbilisis escaped, and in many cases slaughtered, animals liesin their innocence and ignorance. This quality of complete helplessness before the human world and the inability to talk itthrough, as it were, is what makes animals, from loyal pets to wildebeest crossing crocodile-infested rivers, such sure-fire magnets of human feeling.
The bears, lions, tigers, wolves, hyenas and penguins of Tbilisi already lived in the unnatural, mystifying environment of a zoo. Suddenly, these creatures were released by flooding. Then, as they explored a changed reality, they were tranquilised or,shot dead. The photographs of this surreal mayhem are unbearably sad. It is completely reasonable that, even though this disaster took human lives and turned an entire city upside down, the pictures people fixed on were those of a bear perched on a houses air conditioning unit  probably before being shot  or adead tiger being carried away on a stretcher.
Tblisi briefly became a wilderness full of dangerous beasts. Tigers in zoos do not know they are prisoners  they still think they are at the top of the food chain and size up every visitor and keeper as prey. This tiger managed to kill a man before it was shot in the act, it was claimed, of attacking a police officer. It did what came naturally and now it is dead. Its removal on a stretcher at least has a shred of dignity. The most horrible pictures of Tbilisis slaughtered animals show corpses abandoned on riverbanks or in the mud. A boy gingerly prods a dead lions carcass with his foot. A sleuth of bears lie slaughtered in the mud like a friends battalion from the first world war.
That anthroporphism is unavoidable. It is also what makes these images of disaster so compelling. Human dignity rightly forbids us to look on the corpses of drowned strangers from our own species, but animals  as in the art of Damien Hirst or the painter George Stubbs  can carry the burden of a larger tragedy. Zoos , bizarrely, are often at the centre of disaster zones. The carnage in Tbilisi followed comparable chaos in zoos in the Ukraine and Iraq caused not by nature but war. Pity the animals. And pity the world that makes victims and symbols of them.

The tragedy of Tbilisi zoo  what happened next?
Last month a river surge allowed bears, tigers and a giant hippo to escape in the Georgian capital. But the devastating images of stricken animals only told half the story

They were unforgettable pictures: wild animals roaming the streets of Tbilisi last month, after escaping from the citys flood-stricken zoo. The Georgian capital had become an urban jungle. The surreal sight of a giant African hippo lumbering past brightly lit shops and snacking on roadside greenery before being tranquilised and gingerly ushered back inside the devastated zoo complex made front pages worldwide. These were almost biblical scenes of bears fighting to stay above the floodwaters, or mud-caked lions and tigers drowned or shot dead, although there was no ark to come to the rescue.

Some Georgians were annoyed at the way the animals plight had captured the worlds attention; it was also the citys worst human disaster in years . The flash flood that struck on 13 and 14 June claimed at least 19 lives. Three people are still unaccounted for and dozens were left homeless. Four days after the flood, an escaped tiger killed another man . It was a tragedy beyond my imagination, says zoo director Zurab Gurielidze, who only narrowly escaped the surge himself.
Three weeks on, all the animals are now accounted for  including the last missing tiger, whose body was found a few days ago. But the zoo has lost more than 300 animals, either drowned, or shot dead by police  over half its pre-flood population. Exhausted staff are mourning three colleagues who lived on site and were killed in the deluge.

A hippopotamus walks along a flooded street in Tbilisi after zoo animals escaped their enclosures following heavy flooding in the Georgian capital.
With many cages obliterated, staff have had to come up with imaginative solutions for housing the remaining animals. One of the crocodiles is in the penguin enclosure  a hole in the viewing glass now a handy short cut into the pool. The eight surviving penguins  from a batch transferred last year from Torquay zoo in Devon  are having to make do with a smaller cage next to the birds of prey.
Workers are trying to clear enough of the site to meet Gurielidzes ambitious target of reopening by 1 August. If we cant do that, definitely by 1 September, he says. The zoo is a public service. We must be open.
The immediate priority, says zoo spokeswoman Mzia Sharashidze, is finding around 250,000 to build a proper shelter for the now-famous hippo before winter comes. The animal, named Beggi, is currently squatting in part of the elephant pen. It cant survive the cold there, she says.
Longer term, the plan is to raise enough funds to move to a new, larger site on the edge of Tbilisi. But relocation costs have been put at 15m at least  a big sum for Georgia  and the coalition government has not yet said whether it will foot the bill.
It is still reeling from criticism of its handling of the disaster at the zoo, and what was seen as an attempt to shift the blame on to Gurielidze, zoo director since 2006 and now a hugely popular figure. Hundreds of protesters rallied in his support outside government headquarters after he was called in for police questioning. Many of the demonstrators had been among the thousands of volunteers who turned out to help survivors and clear the wreckage, a moment some activists hoped marked a new awakening among young people in this former Soviet republic.

The unusually heavy storm over Tbilisi on the night of Saturday 13 June took everyone by surprise. Two months of rain fell in just a couple of hours. After a late dinner, Gurielidze and his wife, Dr Natia Kopaliani, decided to check on the animals. They arrived around midnight, he says, by which time the rain had stopped. There were lots of puddles, but otherwise everything seemed fine.
We went to check on the hyenas and the pigs, Kopaliani says. Then, suddenly, there was water all around us. There was no noise, but it was rising so fast. It was terrifying. The couple ran to their car, but before they could drive away, the water was up to the doors. Gurielidze and Kopaliani got out of the vehicle just in time, the surge flipping it over as they made it to the top of a nearby animal cage. We kept climbing higher as the water kept rising, Kopaliani says.
In the small zoo accommodation block below them, their three colleagues never stood a chance. Among them was Guliko Chitadze, a veteran staff member who had recently had her arm amputated after one of the tigers attacked her. She had returned to work that week.
Several hours of unimaginable terror lay ahead for Gurielidze and his wife, marooned on top of one of the tiger cages in his own zoo. He knew the tigers below had escaped, along with many other animals, but in the darkness had no idea where they were. The couple couldnt call for help because their mobiles had been washed away. Police sent to the zoo eventually heard their shouting, but wouldnt venture inside because of the threat of attack. Then we heard them shooting animals, says Kopaliani. It was only when the waters began to recede that zoo colleagues and rescue workers finally helped them to safety.

Upstream of the zoo, dozens of houses had been washed away while residents were asleep. Its now thought that a landslide triggered by the rain blocked the Vere river just outside Tbilisi . When this temporary dam then burst under the weight of water, it sent a wave of mud, rock and tree trunks down into the city. The head of Georgias Orthodox church, Patriarch Ilia II, said the flood was punishment for the sin of the countrys former communist rulers, adding that they had paid for the zoo by melting down church crosses and bells.
Others blamed what they saw as government incompetence and poor emergency planning that left residents with no warning of what was coming. Even as the waters were rising around the zoo, the road alongside it remained open, trapping drivers in their cars.
Activist and environmental campaigner Nick Davitashvili says planning has taken a back seat during Georgias post-Soviet evolution. It all used to be done in Moscow, he says. Thankfully, the USSR has gone, and a lot has changed, but no one knows how to plan properly here yet.
The government says it could never have predicted such a disaster, though it is now promising an early warning system along the river. We did everything we could, deploying the emergency services as soon as we knew of the flooding, and we saved a lot of lives, said a spokesman for prime minister Irakli Garibashvili.
Questions were asked about why police deployed at the zoo didnt have tranquilisers and shot so many animals . They gunned down animals without even attempting to save them, says Tina Chavchanidze, chair of the Tbilisi-based Committee for Animal Rights, who has called for better training for police units. The government says that, with the potential threat to human life, police couldnt take a risk.
Even Beggi the hippo  now the symbol for a host of fundraising efforts  only narrowly escaped being shot, after volunteers organised an impromptu rescue. After hearing of the disaster, one of Gurielidzes longtime expedition partners, Levan Butkhuzi, rushed to help. It was chaos when I got there, he says, and no one seemed to be in charge. When the runaway hippo was spotted, he and others persuaded the police to give them a chance to save it, pointing out there were now TV cameras around.
With the zoos tranquiliser stock inaccessible, Butkhuzi called in a friend who runs a bear conservation project two hours outside Tbilisi, telling him to bring all the drugs he had. Hippos are notoriously aggressive, and Beggi weighs more than two tonnes, so it was an agonising wait. Butkhuzi admits they took a further risk when the bear expert arrived, using only a half-dose in the tranquiliser dart. If we had put the hippo to sleep, it would have been impossible to move it, he says.
When, four days after the flood, a tiger killed a warehouse cleaner nearby, officials argued that their actions had been vindicated. But it was also hugely embarrassing, coming after an announcement from the prime minister that all the animals had been accounted for.
Many here in Georgia condemned the foreign medias focus on the zoo. The stories that dominated Georgian coverage were of a pregnant woman being swept from her husbands arms by the surge, and the drowning of Zurab Muzashvili, a 36-year-old emergency worker, after he had saved seven people. But on one of several visits to families hit by the disaster, I was treated instead to typical Georgian hospitality. Im so sorry I cant invite you inside for tea, apologised Ilia Mosikashvili, pointing towards her house, half of which now hangs over a precipitous drop after the ground beneath was washed away.

Many Georgians were also touched by the fate of the animals. Thousands have signed a petition calling for the zoo site to be renamed Shumba park, after the young white lion cub shot by police . The huge volunteer turnout was a moment of great unity, says Davitashvili, who helped to coordinate the effort along with fellow members of the Tbilisi Guerilla Gardeners movement. More than 20,000 people signed up to its Facebook page  although a week after the flood the site was mysteriously blocked, with many suspecting an effort to undermine this sudden burst of people power.
Some predict this more activist mood may simply subside like the floodwaters. But, if nothing else, the protests and open criticism were a sign of democracy becoming increasingly entrenched. With elections next year, the government was rattled, seeking to blame the solidarity protest for the zoo director on the main opposition party. And Davitashvili and other activists believe more Georgians are picking up on the idea that its up to them to stand up for issues they care about.
Back at the zoo, Sharashidze puffs nervously on a cigarette. There used to be only two smokers here, she says. Now almost all of us are. But they have had some good news since the disaster. A rare Caucasian red deer, which the zoo is helping to protect as part of a WWF-backed conservation project, has just given birth to a young female calf. Gurielidze has named her Pyrra, after one of only two survivors of the giant flood in Greek mythology ordered by the god Zeus.

Churches divesting funds for Israeli businesses will hurt Palestinians
A Palestinian girl looks from the window of her family's home south of Gaza City on 28 June 2015. 'With little hope of finding a job and starting a family, growing numbers of young people are risking their lives attempting to leave Gaza,' writes Penny Lawrence of Oxfam.

You report that US churches intend joining the United Church of Christ in divesting funds for Israeli businesses in protest at treatment of Palestinians ( theguardian.com , 1 July). It seems to me that this exercise in self-delusion would be comical if it werent so serious. The whole debacle is based on entirely erroneous beliefs. Just as in the recent case of SodaStream , when all its 600 Palestinian workers were laid off, the livelihoods of thousands of Palestinian workers would be put at risk. Indeed those very fundamental rights of the Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel that the churches bray about will be destroyed willy-nilly.
Fourteen business owners in Israel sent a letter to the Israeli parliament, in which they point out that: In dozens of factories in Judea-Samaria, there are more than 20,000 Palestinian workers who make a living with dignity. Those Palestinians work for higher wages than any in the Palestinian Authority areas. They are the engine powering the Palestinian economy. Do the churches not understand that those workers are likely to be sacked because of the churches ill-considered divestment policy? In what way would that help the Palestinians?
It is time for well-meaning, but deluded,churches to do some serious, relevant research.

Gaza needs rebuilding, but its people also need to be able to move and trade, and to have jobs in a functioning economy
Penny Lawrence, Oxfam GB
 One year ago, the conflict in Gaza erupted and would go on to claim more than 2,000 lives and completely destroy 12,600 homes ( Letters , 8 July). Not one of those homes has been rebuilt, and at current rates the reconstruction will take more than 70 years. An entire generation of young people faces an increasingly bleak future. Gaza has one of the highest rates of unemployment in the world, with two-thirds of young working-age people out of work. The economy has collapsed as a result of a blockade, which restricts people and goods from leaving and essential construction material from entering. With little hope of finding a job and starting a family, growing numbers of young people are risking their lives attempting to leave Gaza.
Gaza needs urgent rebuilding, but its people also need to be able to move and trade, and to have jobs in a functioning economy, which will not come about without an end to the blockade.

Deputy chief executive, Oxfam GB
 One can be a critic of the Netanyahu government but still be appalled by the one-sided attack on Israel by your letter writers. They write of Israels assault on Gaza but omit that this was in response to Hamas rocket attacks on Israel. They refer to findings that Israel committed war crimes in Gaza but omit to mention that Hamas was similarly charged.
Today the greatest threat in the Middle East is Islamic State, which threatens not only Israel but also its allies Jordan and Egypt. It is all too possible that in the near future Israel will be called upon to defend not only itself but its allies from the aggression of Isis, and the policy advocated by your correspondents  for the UK to stop arming Israel  can only aid Isis.

Guardian commentators stress the risks to the euro and the EU itself of not accommodating a Greek default. That countrys flight from both euro and union, they say, would be fearfully dangerous for currency and institution. This is one-sided to the point of being one-eyed. What will happen to both if other hard-pressed countries can default and receive indefinite loans carrying optional repayment? In the same deluded spirit, Aditya Chakrabortty ( Opinion, 7 July ) laments the 2011 appointment in Italy of an unelected technocrat, Mario Monti, and fears something similar in Greece. Dr Monti (technocracy), replacing the buffoon populist, Silvio Burlusconi (democracy), put the Italian economy back into working shape. Dont basic rules matter?

Can Greece really make a drachma as a way out of this crisis?
No one in Athens is mentioning a plan B but if talks to find a deal with creditors fail, Greece will have to print its old currency. Whether it can is another matter

Greeces ability to print its way out of crisis would start at 320 Mesogeion Avenue. It is here, behind high walls and iron bars  daubed with the revolutionary graffiti of anti-capitalist leftists  that the countrys central bank has a currency press.
Set amid pistachio and pine trees, it is also here that Greece once printed drachmas, the worlds oldest currency and the one used from its modern incarnation almost 200 years ago until it joined the single currency. If a euro exit beckoned, and the legal tender was re-embraced, the printing works in the iron-clad building would start to roll.
Related: Greece crisis: Tsipras under pressure to submit reform blueprint to creditors
At this point in the Greek standoff with creditors at the EU and IMF, mere mention of a parallel currency is utterly taboo.
On Wednesday the finance ministry vehemently rejected reports that the leftist-led government was even thinking of introducing Scrip  a substitute for legal tender  to keep up with state payments. Claims that officials had drawn up contingency plans  described in detail by the daily newspaper Kathimerini  were brushed off as being totally baseless.
Such reports, it announced, are directed against the country and considered dangerous at a time when negotiations with creditor partners are at a crucial point.
Even at this very late stage  after five months of fruitless talks and with the EU president, Jean-Claude Juncker, openly admitting that a detailed Grexit scenario is in place, replete with humanitarian aid that the country would receive as it transitioned to the drachma  officials are insisting there is no plan B.
When the former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis let slip at the weekend that there might be one, he was without a job by Monday morning .
If necessary, we will issue parallel liquidity and California-style IOUs, in an electronic form, the erstwhile economics tsar told the Daily Telegraph when asked about the need to pay public-sector employees and pensioners at the end of the month. We should have done it a week ago.
Sources close to the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras , were reported as saying that the statement was reckless when the debt-stricken country was still trying to reach an honourable compromise with the institutions keeping it afloat.
But with state coffers empty, banks closed and capital controls enforced, public-sector payments would be nearly impossible if Athens is not thrown a financial lifeline imminently.
In quick succession, the government must find 3.5bn (2.5bn) to pay the European Central Bank (ECB) by 20 July and another 2bn euros to cover salaries, pensions and social security payments come 31 July.
While a deal with creditors would cover the first, Kathimerini said the general accounting office was preparing IOUs, commonly known as warrants, to honour the latter.
Introduction of the Scrip would, inevitably, pave the way to euro exit, according to experts familiar with the rationale of the ECB.
But with the Greek economy in freefall following the closure of banks  a move triggered by Tsiprass controversial decision to hold a referendum over lenders demands for further austerity  many say it would be derelict of the government if it did not have some sort of contingency plan. Without an emergency infusion of money, it is only a matter of days before cash reserves run dry.
You get the feeling that they are making it up as they go along, Anna Asimakopoulou, shadow finance minister with the main opposition New Democracy party, told the Guardian. They keep saying there is no necessity for a plan B but if we stay in the eurozone or leave we are going to need technical and humanitarian assistance, she countered.
And if, God forbid, it is the latter we are going to need a lot of humanitarian aid because we wont have supplies, we wont have medicines and we probably wont have fuel. All well have is aid and IOUs until we transition to the drachma.
Fourteen years after it entered the eurozone it is far from certain if the country even has the right ink, paper or machinery to print its old currency.
Last week Varoufakis claimed the nation no longer had the presses to make drachmas. He told the Australian radio network ABC: We smashed the printing presses  we have no printing presses.
In 2000, Varoufakis said, before Greece joined the eurozone, one of the things we had to do was get rid of all our printing presses [to ensure] this monetary union is irreversible.
At the currency press on Mesogeion, a roaring avenue on the outskirts of Athens, the guard at the entrance was quick to fend off questions of any kind. Please do not ask anything, he said, a pistol bursting from a holster as he stood up to block the view.
All inquiries should be directed to the finance ministry and the central bank. Only they can tell you what is happening here.

Russia has vetoed a United Nations security council resolution that would have condemned the Srebrenica massacre as a genocide.
The resolution was intended to mark the 20th anniversary of the killing of 8,000 Muslim men and boys.
China, Nigeria, Angola and Venezuela abstained and the remaining 10 members of the council voted in favour.
The vote was delayed a day as Britain and the US tried to persuade Russia not to veto the resolution, which would have also condemned denial that the 1995 massacre was a genocide.
Russias UN ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, said the UK-drafted resolution was not constructive, confrontational and politically motivated.
Russia had instead proposed condemning the most serious crimes of concern to the international community.
A UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague ruled in 2004 that the Srebrenica massacre was a genocide.

On 11 July 1995, toward the end of Bosnias 1992-95 war, Bosnian Serb forces swept into the eastern Srebrenica enclave, a UN-designated safe haven. They killed 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the days that followed, dumping their bodies in pits.
Our vote against  will not however mean that we are deaf to the sufferings of the victims of Srebrenica and other areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina , Churkin said before the vote, adding that such a resolution would lead to greater regional tension.
Serbia acknowledges that a grave crime took place and adopted a declaration condemning the massacre in 2010 as it sought closer ties with the west, but stopped short of describing it as genocide.
Serbia warned on Tuesday that the resolution would only widen ethnic divisions in neighbouring Bosnia.

As if the poor man hasnt suffered enough, with all these women who keep coming forward with allegations of rape and sexual assault dating back decades and now court documents being unsealed in which he admits to obtaining drugs to use on women he wanted to have sex with, Bill Cosby now undergoes the humiliation of having his likeness removed from the Walt Disney World Hall of Fame Plaza. The bronze bust of the comedian, entertainer and alleged multiple rapist will have gone by the time you read this.
With this event, Cosby enters something of a hall of infamy in which decommissioned statuary stands  or rather does not stand  in mute testimony to the strength of feeling occasioned by revelations alleged and actual about once-hallowed figures.
There are a lot of Lenins in there, many of them pulled down during the Euromaidan  a wave of pre-revolution unrest in Ukraine  two years ago, the rest cast away by various groups and countries no longer as keen to celebrate the man responsible for the deaths of millions as they once were. Ditto, apart from the Euromaidan bit, Stalin.
They are joined by fellow dictator and mass murderer Saddam Husseins assorted pieces of iconography, including the famous statue in Firdos Square that was sledgehammered by a local wrestler then pulled down by a US ARV, marking the end of the battle of Baghdad in 2003.

Closer to home, a statue of Michael Jackson commissioned by Mohammed Al Fayed and placed outside Craven Cottage, the home of Fulham football club (then owned by Fayed) in 2011 was removed as soon as the new owner, Shahid Khan, took over last year, though this seems to have been motivated as much by Jacksons lack of relevance to football as by the rumours of his sexual interest in children that swirled around him for years before his death in 2009.
The statue of Joe Paterno , Penn States winningest football coach, was melted down after his involvement in covering up the child abuse perpetrated on a grand scale by his assistant coach Jerry Sandusky came to light.
Jimmy Saviles non-monument in the hall of infamy comprises his gravestone (pulverised at the request of his family to avoid distressing visitors to the cemetery in which the unrepentant predator is buried), a wooden bust at the childrens swimming pool in the Scotstoun sports complex in Glasgow, the plaque on his former house in Scarborough , and innumerable others quietly removed from the childrens wards, mental hospitals and other buildings where he was inexplicably allowed to roam.
What a legacy.

Italian authorities have seized 1.6bn in assets from a set of siblings in Sicily with suspected links to the Cosa Nostra mafia  one of the largest of such seizures to date.
The three brothers and two sisters, ranging in age from 66 to 78, allegedly made their riches by winning public sector construction projects with the help of the Cosa Nostra. Among the seized items were trusts, property and furniture.
Officials said they were targeting known entrepreneurs in the Palermo area who belonged to the Marineo mafia family, which has ties to the Corleone clan.
The court-ordered seizure, made at the behest of an anti-mafia prosecutor, Bernardo Petralia, appears to underline the scale of corruption that is still rife in Italy and how public sector contracts  whether in construction projects or waste management  have often been linked to organised crime.
Italy passed an anti-mafia law in the 1990s that allowed prosecutors to target the assets of suspected criminals. Federico Varese, a criminology professor at Oxford University, said the law has been a key tool in undermining the mafia in Italy, though it had not been without controversy.
According to the agency that manages the seizures, the Italian state currently holds nearly 7,000 assets, which include everything from privately run hospitals to apartment blocks, companies and land.
In Palermo there is a special court whose sole purpose is assigning new managers for seized assets, which, unlike in other countries, are generally not sold by the Italian state. In a lot of these economic enterprises, once they are in the hands of the state they fail, said Varese. They go from being wealthy but corrupt to clean but bankrupt.
The pattern has provoked criticism of the court and Italys management of the assets, but Varese said this was sometimes unfair given that the businesses had often been run through intimidation and corruption and were not necessarily designed to thrive in lawful circumstances.

Name: Micronesia.
Age: Under 23.
Appearance: Perennially slumped of shoulders and miserable, and usually picking a football out of the back of the net.
Status: Whipping boys of the Pacific Games.
Pacific Games, eh? Sounds prestigious. Yes, but not especially enjoyable if you happen to be a fan of Micronesia . Theyve just finished bottom of their group.
Were they eliminated due to a last-minute own-goal howler, much like Englands proud footballing Lionesses? Not quite. They started with a 30-0 against Tahiti, followed that up with a hard-fought 38-0 defeat against Fiji, then lost 46-0 to Vanuatu .
Who is to blame for this debacle? At whose managerial desk does the buck stop? Their Australian coach is Stan Foster.
I have not heard of this man. Hes a recent addition to the managerial set-up. Interestingly, one of his managerial predecessors was none other than Paul Watson .
Ah yes. And who might he be? Well, for one thing, he is the brother of stand-up comedian Mark Watson . But he also turned his experiences of managing Micronesia in 2009 and 2010 into a book, Up Pohnpei , which in turn looks set to be made into a film.
And can he shed any light on the teams current trough in form? Lack of funding. He compares sending a team like Micronesia out against the giants of Fiji as being like sending a Sunday league team out to play Liverpool .
If theyre so terrible at football, why do they do it? Its a matter of principle and pride and the possibility of Fifa funding. If Micronesia keep putting a team out in tournaments, even if they keep getting hammered like this, they will qualify for Fifa development funding and may - wonder of wonders - actually receive it some day.
Presumably theyll receive it in a plain brown envelope or in the form of expensive watches. Yes, thats very biting and current, well done.
Is there any hope for Micronesia? Could they ever be the footballing mouse that roared? Absolutely. To give you some idea of what these tiny teams can do, only a few weeks ago the island of Guam, whose population of about 160,000 is not that much larger than that of Micronesia, beat India (population: 1.252 billion) 2-1 in a World Cup qualifier .
Do say: Fijis 33rd was clearly offside and we spotted a push on the keeper for their 39th.
Dont say: Can we play you/ Can we play you/ Can we play you every week?

Gaza: how it looks one year after the conflict  then and now
8 July marks the first anniversary of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The 50-day conflict began when Israel launched an intense air and ground assault aiming to end persistent rocket fire from Gaza. It was the third major conflict between Israel and Hamas militants since the Islamist group took control of Gaza in 2007. Last years fighting killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, most of them civilians, as well as 73 Israelis, most of them soldiers. More than 100,000 buildings in Gaza were left damaged or destroyed and have not been rebuilt

Malaysian police have raided the HQ of a state-controlled investment fund at the centre of a major corruption scandal engulfing the countrys embattled prime minister, Najib Razak.
Razak is facing mounting calls to resign after a Wall Street Journal report last week about debt-laden state fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) alleged that nearly $700m (456m) went into his bank accounts.
It was the first time Najib has been directly implicated in the investigation into 1MDB, which is weighed down by an estimated $11bn of debt. The prime minister launched the fund in 2009 and still chairs its advisory board.
Critics led by the countrys former leader Mahathir Mohamad, who still wields much influence, have called for an explanation amid claims of financial mismanagement and murky overseas deals at 1MDB.

The fund confirmed the raid and said it had provided officials with a number of documents and materials to aid with the investigations currently taking place. Najib reiterated that there was a political plot against him, writing on his blog: I would like to stress again that I have never taken 1MDBs funds for personal use.
The Wall Street Journals accusation is made with malicious intent and supported by certain quarters in the country with the purpose of forcing me to resign as prime minister and Umno [party] president.
However, Najib, who took office in 2009 and is the son of a former premier, faces increasing pressure with his failure to issue an outright denial. 1MDB has previously denied any wrongdoing.
The source of the money was not clear, the WSJ said, adding that the bulk of the funds were transferred from a company registered in the British Virgin Islands through the Singapore branch of a Swiss private bank in 2013, before a tight national election race.
The Barisan Nasional coalition of parties, led by Najib, went on to win the 2013 polls but lost the popular vote for the first time to the opposition alliance  headed by Anwar Ibrahim , who is currently serving a five-year prison term after being convicted of sodomy.
The WSJ has published some of the documents online to show the alleged money trail. The Guardian was not able to independently verify the documents.
A taskforce investigating the matter has frozen six bank accounts suspected to be involved in the case, while Singapores central bank said it was cooperating with Malaysian authorities over the inquiry.
Writing on his blog on Tuesday, Mahathir accused Najib  his one-time protege  for shaming the nation, while the veteran opposition politician Lim Kit Siang said Malaysia cannot afford to have a prime minister who has been stripped of all credibility.
This article was amended on 8 July 2015. The original headline said the prime ministers office had been raided. This was wrong and has been corrected

All United Airlines flights were temporarily grounded on Wednesday because of automation issues, according to the US Federal Aviation Administration.
Flights were grounded at all airports and all facilities nationwide for more than an hour. Residual delays were expected throughout the day.
Before the advisory was announced, travellers had posted complaints about flight delays.
We are recovering from a network connectivity issue this morning and restoring regular flight operations, United said in an emailed statement. We will have a waiver available at united.com for customers who are able to change their flight plans.

Denver international airport advised passengers on United to allow extra time for their flights as airline works to restore computer issues. Washington Dulles international airport also said that United is experiencing computerized system issues.
United Airlines said it serves 235 domestic airports and has 4,935 daily departures. United Airlines also temporarily grounded flights because of automation issues in early June.

The primary role of the Royal Navy ship that is leading Britains contribution to saving lives in the Mediterranean is not search and rescue, but to gather intelligence on people smugglers, according to the immigration minister.
James Brokenshire confirmed that Britains search-and-rescue contribution has been scaled back since the withdrawal of HMS Bulwark  which was capable of carrying more than 1,000 migrants at a time  and its replacement with HMS Enterprise, a survey ship one-fifth its size.
The minister told a House of Lords committee that although HMS Bulwark had been involved in saving more than 4,000 lives, HMS Enterprise was now engaged in a different role in gathering intelligence on migrant flows as part of the first phase of the new EU operation to prevent the smugglers vessels leaving north Africa in the first place.
Two smaller Border Force cutters would continue to take part in the EUs proactive search and rescue operations. Brokenshire warned there were an estimated 500,000 - 600,000 people in Libya who wanted to make the journey northwards across the Mediterranean to Europe .
He insisted that the vast majority were economic migrants and not refugees, despite coming from Sudan, Somalia and Eritrea  a claim which drew repeated requests from peers for evidence to back up his claim.
Brokenshire said Britains priorities were to ensure that those who made it across the Mediterranean to Italy and Greece were fingerprinted and logged on European asylum databases, and to support the development of processing centres in Niger and the Horn of Africa to stem the flow of those wanting to travel to Europe.
He attacked the European Unions proposed scheme to relocate 40,000 migrants across Europe over the next two years, saying it would make trying to get across the Mediterranean to Italy and Greece an attractive option. It is moving the problem around and dealing with the symptons and not the causes, he said.
Britain has refused to take part in the EU relocation scheme and Brokenshire said it was simply making an already difficult situation worse, as he addressed the House of Lords EU committee. We have to look beyond the shores of Europe to break the flow of migrants and that is where the emphasis should lie rather than on relocation within Europe, he said.
He particularly highlighted the danger that those relocated from Italy and Greece would not stay in the European state they had been sent to but would instead rapidly move to more desirable destinations within Europe.
Brokenshire disclosed that Britain is among those EU states putting Italy and Greece under the strongest pressure to fingerprint all new migrant arrivals on their shores and to log their movement on the Eurodac database set up to track the movements of asylum seekers across Europe. He revealed new data that suggests that as many as 55,000 migrants who arrived in Italy in 2014 have not been fingerprinted and registered, with the implication that they had been allowed to move on without any problems.
The minister insisted that Britain was making a significant contribution to the Mediterranean refugee crisis, including making available 900m in aid for Syrian refugees and making the biggest contribution to a joint European asylum processing effort in the frontline states, with more than 1,000 working days being contributed by British staff.
The Refugee Council responded to Brokenshires evidence by tweeting: Minister talking about smashing smugglers to prevent lives being put at risk. Lives are already at risk: thats why people gamble on the Med. It added that his claim that the majority were migrants wilfully ignored the fact that the biggest group were Syrians.

Lorry drivers continue to face delays in southern England following the death on Tuesday of a migrant after he tried to jump on a moving train in Calais.
Police said the long queues of lorries in Kent were a knock-on effect from the fatality, which disrupted freight and passenger traffic going through the Channel tunnel. For a second day, Operation Stack  where HGVs are queued on the M20 in Kent between junctions 8 and 9  remained in place.
Related: Migrant dies on UK-bound freight train near Calais
Operation Stack remains in place today in response to ongoing issues in Calais and the volume of traffic currently in Kent, said a Kent police spokesman.
The Port of Dover said it remained open for business with full services operating to Calais with P&amp;O Ferries and to Dunkirk with DFDS Seaways.
Traffic is currently flowing and the port and the ferry operators are working hard to serve all customers travelling to and from the continent, said a port spokesman. We apologise for any delays or inconvenience as a result of the traffic congestion and we would like to reassure our local community we are playing our part to keep traffic, Dover and the UK economy moving.
Meanwhile, further details have emerged about Tuesdays fatality. A Eurotunnel spokesman said a young man suffered head injuries while trying to jump on a moving train early on Tuesday morning. The French public prosecutor in Boulogne-sur-Mer , Pierre Valensi, said the man was probably from Eritrea and that an autopsy would be carried out to confirm the cause of death.
In recent years, hundreds of thousands of have fled the small country in the Horn of Africa to escape highly repressive rule. About 5,000 Eritreans leave their country each month, according to the UN .
The migrant crisis in Calais has escalated in recent months, with around 3,000 people displaced from countries including Eritrea, Syria and Afghanistan setting up camp  known as Jungle II  near the port. The migrants have tried to get on trains and lorries in their desperate efforts to reach the UK. An Eritrean man died while trying to get on a train at Coquelles last month and it is thought that four people have died since June trying to get to the UK from Calais.
The French authorities have come under fire for not doing enough to safeguard lorry drivers from intimidation, violence and attempts by migrants to climb on.
The Road Haulage Association (RHA) has suggested the deployment of the French military to boost security in Calais to protect truckers. The Freight Transport Association (FTA) wrote to David Cameron, the prime minister, this week, saying the situation in Calais was deplorable and conditions for drivers had reached unacceptable levels.
Last week, desperate migrants tried to break into stationary vehicles during a strike by French ferry workers in Calais who set fire to tracks inside the Channel tunnel. The strike came during a heatwave, prompting police to warn motorists to take precautions during long delays .

An Iraqi court has sentenced to death 24 militants for their role in killing hundreds of soldiers. Four others were acquitted for lack of evidence.
Islamic State (Isis) captured the soldiers when it overran Saddam Husseins hometown of Tikrit last summer. They were trying to flee from Camp Speicher, a nearby army base. After Tikrit was captured, Isis posted graphic images and video that showed its gunmen massacring scores of the soldiers after loading the captives on to flatbed trucks and then forcing them to lie face down in a shallow ditch.
All of the defendants pleaded not guilty, insisting they never took part in the massacre. They told the court that their confessions were coerced under torture by Iraqi officers.
At one point, while the chief judge was questioning the militants, several relatives of the dead soldiers stormed the courtroom and started to throw shoes and water bottles at the defendants, who were inside a cage.
After the sentences were passed, the victims relatives raised pictures of their loved ones. Some burst into tears and others chanted Allahu Akbar, and oh, Hussein, in reference to the prophet Muhammads grandson, who is revered by Shias.
Ali Abdul-Hamza, whose brother was among the victims, said justice is done as he was leaving the courtroom. We are relieved to see these criminals receiving the maximum punishment, he said.
Before the trial, the spokesman for Iraqs supreme judicial council, Abdul-Sattar Bayrkdar, promised that the trial will be transparent and fair.
He added that 604 other militants, believed to have taken part in the killing, were still at large.
Following the retaking of Tikrit city four months ago , dozens of people allegedly linked to the massacre were arrested by Iraqi security forces. Iraqi forensic teams immediately began exhuming bodies from mass graves believed to contain some of of soldiers killed by Isis militants.

UK court rejects Afghan interpreters' discrimination claims
Judges dismiss challenge to UK assistance scheme brought by two Afghans regarded by Taliban as infidel spies for working with British military

Former local interpreters who risked their lives working for the British military in Afghanistan have lost their high court challenge to a government assistance scheme they say unlawfully discriminates against them.
The two men  Afghans regarded by the Taliban as infidel spies  applied for judicial review at the court.
They argued that the scheme was unfair and unlawful because, with certain exceptions, assistance is not available under the scheme to staff who left British employment before December 2012.
Their lawyers contended they were being discriminated against and treated differently to Iraqi interpreters who were given assistance when their lives became endangered through assisting the British in the Iraq war.
They wanted the Afghan scheme to cover locally engaged staff employed by the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office in Afghanistan before the 2012 cutoff date.
Lord Justice Burnett and Mr Justice Irwin were asked to declare that the deadline was unfair and made the scheme discriminatory under the Equality Act 2010 and breached common law and the governments public sector equality duty.
But the judges ruled the territorial reach of 2010 act is not such as to include the claimants circumstances. The judges also ruled that the common law claim has no substance.
There had been a government failure to have regard to relevant equality duty matters under the 2010 act when formulating the Afghan assistance scheme, but it was a procedural issue and did not entitle the Afghans to any relief, they declared.
However, Burnett said permission to appeal to the court of appeal would be granted because of the novelty of the issues relating to discrimination the case raised.
The ruling was a defeat for a man referred to as AL, who, the court was told at a hearing in May, remains in Afghanistan and is in constant danger and facing Taliban death threats. The other claimant, Mohammed Rafi Hottak, a father of three, has already claimed asylum in the UK but has been unable to benefit from the assistance scheme.
The legal challenge was against the Ministry of Defence and Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
Hottak, who fled Afghanistan in 2011 after receiving death threats, said of the MoD and FCO: I risked bombs and bullets working for them. The people who I considered as friends and family, they are fighting me for my rights and the rights of my friends in Afghanistan.
The scheme under challenge dates back to the announcement of the drawdown of UK forces from Afghanistan in 2012. It was introduced to aid interpreters and other local staff deemed to be engaged in dangerous and challenging roles with the British, who had been in post on December 19 2012 and had served more than 12 months.
With certain exceptions, staff whose employment ended before that date, either voluntarily or for disciplinary reasons, were not eligible.
Rosa Curling, a lawyer at solicitors Leigh Day whois representing the Afghans, said they would seek to appeal. She said: The court clearly recognised that the British forces operating in Afghanistan could not have functioned without the assistance of locally employed staff, including men like our clients, former interpreters who exposed themselves to considerable personal risk.
The Taliban have exacted revenge against these locally employed staff, who have been subject to intimidation. Some have been attacked and killed. Yet despite this, a scheme equitable to the Iraqi scheme is not available to those Afghans to who we owe a great debt of honour.
We are disappointed by the decision and the failure to recognise this debt and we will be seeking to appeal the decision.

Half-tonne fighting bulls were let loose in the narrow streets of Pamplona, northern Spain, on Tuesday for the first run of the annual San Fermin bull-running festival. In the two minutes and 23 seconds it took for the bulls to barrel down the 930 yards from the holding pen to the bullring, 11 people, including one Briton, were injured. None of the injuries were considered life-threatening. The festival was made famous in Ernest Hemingways 1926 novel The Sun Also Rises. Photograph: Pablo Blazquez Dominguez/Getty Images

Dorothea Burke is standing in the street, staring at her house. Its a warm day in late May and after a hard Pittsburgh winter, Burke and many of her neighbours are in home improvement mode. Drills and power saws blare in the background. New windows are going in across the street and the house next to it is on the market. Facing her house, Burke, a 23-year resident of this block, is thinking about repointing her brickwork and maybe a paint job. People are finally taking pride in their homes, she says.
For this neighbourhood, East Liberty, once one of the citys most dangerous and crime-ridden, the air of optimism and reinvestment is a stark contrast to darker days in the recent past.
It wasnt peaceful before, Burke says. A few years ago, two teenagers tried to rob an older neighbour who protected himself by shooting them both dead. From her balcony, she would watch police lights flashing on a problem house at the corner  sometimes after gunshots, but mostly for drugs. It was almost a weekly thing, she recalls. Then, a couple years ago, the property got new management, she says, and the cops stopped coming.
To many here who lived through years or decades of instability , it seems the entire neighbourhood is under new management. Crime is down. Vacant lots and abandoned homes are being redeveloped. Property values are rising. The streets are feeling safe and calm.
They were the worst public housing projects in the region and they were anchoring our neighbourhood

Much of this transition is the work of East Liberty Development Inc , a community development corporation that has systematically bought abandoned homes and criminal hotspots, bought out slumlords throughout the 400-acre neighbourhood and redeveloped the properties into stable, well-managed, affordable and market-rate housing. We took on a huge risk, says Kendall Pelling, ELDIs director of land recycling. We owned the 250 worst properties in a blighted neighbourhood and wed borrowed most of the money to get them. But the risk paid off: violent crime dropped roughly in half , and, for the first time in decades, homebuyers are looking at East Liberty as a place to live.
Its a long awaited rebirth. In the early 20th century, the neighbourhood was a thriving commercial district that many called the second downtown of a city made prosperous by the steel and glass industries. But a 1960s urban renewal project drained much of the neighbourhoods vitality and concentrated its poverty in large public housing projects. One of those towers literally rose up and straddled the areas main thoroughfare, creating an intimidating gateway to the neighbourhood. People would throw stuff out of their windows at you when you drove through, recalls ELDI executive director Maelene Myers, who has been with the organisation since 1996. They were the worst public housing projects in the region and they were anchoring our neighbourhood, says Pelling. East Liberty became a neighbourhood to avoid.
Decades of cyclical poverty and disinvestment ensued. Deindustrialisation more than halved the citys peak population of 676,000 in 1950. Then, in 1999, a community plan was drafted to reshape East Liberty. The big public housing projects were demolished and replaced with mid- and low-rise, mixed use and mixed income developments. New commercial development was encouraged. In 2002, a Whole Foods grocery store opened. An Ace Hotel is in the works . Things started to change, if slowly.

But on its residential streets, long-term problems persisted. Blocks littered with abandoned homes and vacant lots became magnets for crime. Property values hovered around $50,000  low for the city  but most of those homes needed at least that much in renovations and repairs, so many sat and continued to decay.
ELDI began buying empty lots and abandoned or foreclosed homes and making the piecemeal investments to turn them into quality homes. But the scale of the problem was huge. The standard community development approach was woefully inadequate, says Pelling. We had 80 abandoned houses in the neighbourhood. Doing two or three of them wasnt going to change the market.
Around the corner is a building ELDI bought after the US Marshals seized it from a major cocaine distributor
As a non-profit developer embedded in the community, ELDI met regularly with residents to hear their concerns and ideas. When talk inevitably turned to crime, a recurrent worry was slumlords  hands-off landlords who had, through neglect, allowed their properties to be used for criminal activities. Drugs, prostitution and violence were common, and though their negative impacts spread across East Liberty, the sources were a relatively small amount of buildings. All the neighbours knew exactly who was dealing. They know who his grandmother is. But the police have to build a case for that and its a slow process, Pelling says of the slumlord-crime connection. We knew it, but it scared the hell out of us.
In 2003, ELDI decided that the only way to stop that problem was to remove the slumlords. It doesnt matter if its a 14-storey tower with no management and bad conditions or a 3-storey house with no management and bad conditions, its the same damn thing, says Eric Jester, who worked with Pelling to spearhead the slumlord buyout program but who has since left ELDI. By 2007, ELDI developed a viable financial model to begin a large-scale buyout of some of the slumlords many neighbours had complained about for years. One of its first major buyouts  an $8.2m project  turned a scattered group of decaying buildings and empty lots into 41 units of mixed income housing.
Walking through the neighbourhood recently, Pelling points out some of the properties ELDI has acquired  homes where people had been murdered and prostitution thrived. He passes an apartment building where the hallways were basically 24-hour drug markets. Around the corner is a building they bought after the US Marshals service seized it from a major cocaine distributor. I still have a full 9mm clip that fell out of the drop ceiling, Pelling says. Its my paper weight.

Through its targeted slumlord buyout program, ELDI bought up more than 200 housing units in the neighbourhood, about 3% of the total housing stock. They contracted a property manager to screen and remove problematic tenants. For the most troubled properties, off-duty police officers were hired to make random patrols. Based on neighbourhood feedback, a few properties have been redeveloped as supportive housing, one for women in recovery and another for chronically homeless men. One row of houses has developed into a co-housing community, with a big shared garden.
While still at ELDI, Jester made a personal bet on East Liberty. In the mid 2000s, he bought a home in its most active crime hotspot  the worst end of the worst block, he says. But over the years, ELDI has gradually bought and redeveloped many homes on this problem block, and Jester has watched as the crime has nearly disappeared. To see if numbers would support his observations, Jester pulled crime statistics and had a map made to show how the incidence of crime changed. On his block, a former red blotch of repeated crimes and arrests, the incidence of crime dropped significantly in just a few years.
ELDI was cooling East Libertys criminal hotspots through real estate development. To better understand why, ELDI commissioned a study from Pittsburgh-based consultants Numeritics , which tracked the incidence of crime against the locations of ELDIs interventions.
The correlations were clear: where ELDI invested and rehabilitated properties, the crime gradually decreased. Between 2008 and 2012, serious crimes against persons  aggravated assault, homicide, rape and robbery  decreased by 54% in East Libertys residential areas. Total crime  including property crimes and crimes reported in the commercial center of East Liberty  dropped from 221 crimes per thousand residents in 2008 to 164 crimes per thousand residents in 2012.

The idea that community development is a mechanism to address crime is not new at all. Its just demonstrated vividly in this case, says Alex Schwartz, a professor of urban policy at the New School in New York and an expert in community development. There are various reasons for investing in housing and engaging in housing revitalisation. Part of it is providing more affordable housing, but its also to remove blight or address other neighbourhood problems. So this is an example of some of these other ancillary benefits of community development.
Change is underway. Walking through East Liberty, theres hardly a block without at least one home on the market and others undergoing renovations. Trucks with construction materials rumble down streets and stacks of two-by-fours sit on the sidewalks. More white families are moving into what has long been a predominantly black neighbourhood. A teenage couple walks hand in hand after school, and a group of boys on bikes gathers near a corner. Down the block, a few slightly older males snicker as they walk in the late afternoon sun, holding cans of malt liquor. The grit of a tough neighbourhood hasnt completely disappeared.
Justin Cummings, a real estate agent whos lived in the neighbourhood for about nine years, says things have been improving. He recently bought two houses side by side  one for his family and one to rent. As he waters plants in his large backyard, he points across the street to a house where someone had been murdered a few years ago, and to a place around the corner where a crack dealer was recently arrested. But in the near-decade hes lived in East Liberty, hes seen the incidence and concentration of crime drop. It was block by block five years ago, he says. Now its house by house.

A few streets over, Dee Peters is tending to her modest front garden. A 13-year resident, she says things have calmed in recent years, but still flare up, especially during summer. Shes noticed the work of ELDI, but says its up to residents to create more systemic change. When things go wrong, were the ones calling the police because were the ones that live here. They dont, she says.
Some worry that ELDIs interventions may lead to wealthier people displacing the neighbourhoods poorer residents. Pelling argues thats unlikely, as most of the housing ELDI has developed or renovated is permanent affordable housing for people with low incomes. You cant have a gentrifying neighbourhood where 38% of the units are subsidised affordable rentals, he says. Its impossible.
But its clear that this approach has led to some inevitable displacement. The property managers contracted by ELDI can essentially blacklist problem tenants from renting in any of their controlled properties. During a tour of the neighbourhood, Pelling is approached by one such former tenant, clearly down on her luck, inquiring about any openings. He tells her no, there isnt anything available right now, but she suspects thats not the full truth. Did I do something wrong? she asks, over and over. Pelling eventually concedes: because of the problems shed caused in the past, the property manager doesnt want to rent to her. Pelling tells her hell see what he can do, but the situation is unlikely to change. ELDIs approach to reducing the incidence of crime relies squarely on removing those individuals who cause or enable that crime.

Since 2002, ELDI has acquired and stabilised more than 500 rental units, which accounts for 20% of the neighbourhoods rental stock. Though the transformation from East Libertys past is by no means comprehensive, ELDIs intervention in the neighbourhood has been uniquely strategic, according to Stefani Danes, a research associate at the Remaking Cities Institute at Carnegie Mellon university in Pittsburgh. They recognised that their resources are very limited, so they made a deliberate decision to focus resources where they would make the biggest difference, she says. But she also notes that the shortage of funding has limited this approach. Shes tracked the impacts of ELDIs work and has noticed that blocks with more buyouts have fared much better than those with just a few. One, the 700 block of Collins Street, she says, is still deteriorating. The investment that was made in a couple of properties hasnt turned it around and those properties are now vulnerable to more deterioration. Thats the risk when you spread your investment around in many different blocks.
ELDI has relied on low-interest loans from local banks and the support of foundations to be able to acquire these properties. A city programme enables ELDI to buy abandoned homes for only a few thousand dollars, but those still need upwards of $100,000 in work. ELDI is heavily reliant on receiving tax credits for the creation of low-income housing, but those dont always come through. Through a homeowner programme, ELDI sells some renovated homes at both affordable and market rates to help subsidise its work on the riskier projects that are less likely to break even. More than 100 units have been built or renovated for sale, at an investment of more than $25m.
Funding remains a challenge, which has been frustrating for Pelling. But hes hoping the crime reduction numbers theyve helped produce will encourage institutional lenders to ease their lending restrictions and the city to offer more generous tax credits to help ELDI expand this effort.
In this country, weve tried everything else to reduce crime, Pelling says. Why not try this?

Tokyo readies for the rise of the 'guerrilla rainstorm'
Japans capital may be known for its earthquake resilience strategies, but a recent increase in intense, sudden storms poses another threat  one that the citys flood protection systems may not be able to manage

When people speak of natural disasters in Tokyo , they usually mean the major earthquake that seismologists say will eventually strike the Japanese capital. But for the local government, weather-related disasters are as much if not more of an immediate worry. The citys coastal location puts it in the path of the Asia-Pacific regions most violent typhoons  and there has been a measurable increase in the strength of rainstorms in recent years.
Tokyos rainfall in 2014 was about 20% above normal, but the kind of storms that have struck the capital lately are different than they were in the past. Many are caused by huge cumulus clouds that form quickly and in succession when moist air from the ocean comes up against the warm air trapped among tall, closely packed buildings. Locally, these sudden, intense downpours are called guerrilla storms, because they seem to attack out of nowhere.
Two years ago, four workers who were reinforcing storm sewers drowned when such a storm hit unexpectedly. The main problem in these situations is that Tokyo is covered with concrete and has many levels of underground infrastructure: there is no ground soil to absorb water. The city has two sewer systems, one for runoff and one for sewage, and when rainfall exceeds 50mm/hour the water is diverted automatically into the sewage channels, which fill up and have to be diverted into the sea, meaning raw sewage ends up in the environment without being treated. Last year, during one storm, Taito Ward in eastern Tokyo received 150mm in one hour.

Tokyo is covered with concrete  there is no ground soil to absorb water
About 30% of the prefectures population lives below sea level, mostly along Tokyo Bay or the many rivers that feed into it. The levees that were built roughly 300 years ago to protect the downstream areas havent always been sufficient. In 1948, Typhoon Kathleen submerged most of the northwestern portion of the city under three metres of water when the Tone River breached its banks. More than 1,000 people died and 31,000 homes were destroyed. The storm was considered a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon, and the low-lying areas have become even more populated in the intervening years, with landfill extending far into the bay. Levees have been reinforced, but the metropolitan government knows it is not enough.
One of the biggest recent flood prevention projects is an underground discharge channel that was completed six years ago about 25 miles north of the city in Kasukabe. The structure feeds overflow from five rivers into a man-made underground reservoir through a huge shaft and a tunnel more than 4 miles in length. Four pumps can handle as much as 200 cubic metres of water a second. The mechanism goes a long way toward diverting excess water that flows down from the upper reaches of the Kanto Plain, but may have less effect in the event of heavy rains that fall directly on the city.

Ward governments have asked private property owners to build special runoff systems under their land so that when there is excess rain it can be absorbed into the soil, alleviating the citys burden for runoff. Some even offer to subsidise such construction, but without regulations that compel landowners to do so, few have undertaken the work.
Experts dont think that structural precautions alone can safeguard a city such as Tokyo from extraordinary storms
Another flood-prevention project is the super levees that the central government is attempting to build along 540 miles of six rivers. The work involves increasing the elevation of existing levees. But if they are made higher, the base has to be widened in order for them to maintain their structural integrity, and since tightly packed residential neighbourhoods are already situated along the levees, houses have to be condemned and residents forced to move when the work is carried out. Japan has a very weak concept of eminent domain, and between the late 1980s when the project began and 2012 when it was suspended temporarily due to budget concerns, only 5.4% of the planned work had been done. At that rate it will take 400 years to complete, and many people in and out of the government believe the project is merely a public works boondoggle that has more to do with enriching construction companies than with saving lives.
In any case, experts dont think that structural precautions alone can safeguard a city such as Tokyo from extraordinary storms. This spring, Japans public broadcaster, NHK, aired a series of special programmes on mega-disasters, one of which addressed guerrilla rainstorms and super typhoons. Worst case scenarios were simulated using computer graphics, showing how subways and underground spaces would be completely inundated and streets submerged under at least three metres of water. Though such a situation would be rare, it is also seen as inevitable. Consequently, more research has gone into predicting heavy rainfall, especially when its focused on a small area.

As NHK pointed out, the best way to save lives is to make sure residents know when a storm is coming and what they can expect in their area. Local governments distribute hazard maps that tell residents whether or not their localities are subject to inundation, whether by overwhelmed sewers or by overflowing tributaries. Combined with a storm prediction system, residents can evacuate when a warning is given. This summer, a system devised by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism that predicts rain storms of more than 30mm/hour is being tested that can give ten minute warnings to affected areas.
Ten minutes isnt much time, but if people decide to evacuate, where do they go, especially if they live in a neighbourhood thats below sea level? Local governments designate evacuation points in multi-story public buildings, such as schools, but depending on where a resident lives it could be a long walk  and authorities warn against moving around outside during a flood. Some communities are making their own arrangements. Yoshii Ishii, the 83-year-old head of the neighbourhood association of Minami Senju, a cramped warren of wooden houses located near the Sumida River, told us three years ago that he had come to an understanding with several high-rise condominiums that had been built in the area since 2000. We had a meeting, he said. They said we can use their building in the event of an emergency.
The proliferation of tower condos in recent years has been controversial for their performance in earthquakes, but tall buildings also exacerbate the heat island phenomenon that contributes to guerrilla storms. For the residents of Minami Senju, however, skyscrapers make up for the flooding they could be indirectly causing by providing higher, drier ground.

On 29 August 2005, Hurricane Katrina , one of the US deadliest hurricanes, reached New Orleans. What followed crippled the city, causing loss of life and destroying peoples homes. The levee system designed to protect the city from storm surges failed disastrously and the large majority of Greater New Orleans was severely flooded. Less than a month later, Hurricane Rita added insult to injury.
Recovery and rebuilding efforts drew mass attention, not least for their celebrity spearheading . As well as repairing the damage and restoring the city, projects have tried to ensure greater resilience for the future . One currently in progress is a hurricane-proof hospital , designed upside-down so the emergency room is above the flood line.
It is now approaching 10 years since Hurricane Katrina. No one wants another major natural disaster to hit, but if it did, what would be its impact? Is New Orleans now stronger and better protected? Is each neighbourhood as prepared as the next?
If you live in New Orleans, share your thoughts, stories, images and videos on whether the city feels stronger since Katrina. What has been done to increase disaster preparedness? Do you feel more protected than before Katrina? What else would you like to see happen to make New Orleans more resilient?

        <title>Radioactive city: how Johannesburg’s townships are paying for its mining past</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jul/06/radioactive-city-how-johannesburgs-townships-are-paying-for-its-mining-past</Link>

Johannesburgs mine dumps look strangely beautiful from a distance. Lustrously yellow in the sun, blazing red at dusk, their huge molehill shapes provide the city with its distinctive skyline.
Up close, its a different story. Rasalind Plaatjies has lived in the shadow of a tailing  as these piles of mine waste are known  all her adult life. Today, the 62-year-old grandmother from the citys Riverlea district suffers severe respiratory problems. For 16 hours a day, she is hooked up to an oxygen tank, her lungs debilitated by dust from the waste heap.
Sometimes I dont have the energy to get up. I just have to stay in bed and do nothing, she says. She feels fortunate, though. A number of her elderly neighbours have died from respiratory disease.
Plaatjies is one of tens of thousands in Johannesburgs impoverished townships who are paying a high cost for the citys rich mining past. More than 600 abandoned mines surround South Africas largest city, with much of their waste now piled up high next to residential communities  most of which are poor and black.

Residents here fear the wind most. When it blows, fine particles from these man-made dumps are carried up into the air and deposited on to residents homes. It is no ordinary dust, either: the residue of decades of mining, it can contain traces of everything from copper and lead to cyanide and arsenic .
During August and September, the dust is terrible. You stop cleaning the floor after a while. Its just useless, says Plaatjies.
In the local clinic, respiratory cases such as tuberculosis and asthma are ubiquitous across all age groups, says Musa Mbatha, chairman of the clinics civic committee. Rashes and skins diseases are commonplace, too.
People cant afford to buy food every day, so they leave the food and it gets contaminated, Mbatha adds. The government said that it would do a survey of the health impacts of the mining dust, but until today it hasnt happened.
Johannesburg is undoubtedly the most uranium-contaminated city in the world
Dr Antony Turton
An even more dangerous pollutant is lurking in Johannesburgs mine dumps, however: radioactive waste. According to one university study, an estimated 600,000 metric tonnes of radioactive uranium are buried in waste rock in and around Johannesburg  around three times what was exported during the Cold War .
[Johannesburg] is undoubtedly the most uranium-contaminated city in the world, says Dr Antony Turton, a professor at the University of Free States Centre for Environmental Management.
Uranium naturally occurs in reefs alongside gold, meaning the two are often excavated at the same time. For every tonne of gold mined in the Witwatersrand gold fields  the southern sections of which border western Johannesburg  between 10 and 100 tonnes of uranium were also mined .

For most of the gold mines, uranium was merely a waste product and therefore dumped without being recovered. Those tailing disposal facilities therefore have a relatively high uranium concentration today, Turton says.
Without the proper precautions in place, ore-bearing uranium leaches from the tailings and enters as run-off into surrounding streams and wetlands. A similar process occurs in abandoned mines underground, with polluted water seeping through porous rock as the mines flood.
Despite its vast reserves of groundwater, Johannesburg pumps most of its drinking water from Lesotho  more than 380km away  because its own water reserves are too polluted.

Mine waste is also removed illegally from tailings for use in the manufacture of bricks and for other construction purposes, some environment groups allege. Potentially, the physical infrastructure of Johannesburg could be becoming radioactive as well.
The release of uranium in dust form can be exacerbated by the re-mining of tailings  a process that happens in various locations across the city. The companies involved in this re-mining maintain that they are providing an environmental service by removing waste and depositing it in modern tailings that are better regulated.
David van Wyk, chief researcher at the Bench Marks Foundation , a church-funded non-profit based in Johannesburg, is sceptical about mining companies environmental practices. When the uranium price is very low, the mining companies simply dump it. Thats why the dust is yellow. We call it yellow cake, he says.
Bench Marks, which receives support from UK charity Christian Aid , is mid-way through a three-year impact assessment of pollution levels in an around Johannesburgs Soweto district. By systematically tracking air and water contamination, Bench Marks hopes to provide a scientific basis for the alleged health impacts of the tailings.
A handful of randomised spot-checks reveal the extent of the pollution problem. For example, in a narrow run-off canal immediately opposite Soccer City, site of the 2010 Fifa World Cup final, van Wyk picks out the colours along the bank: red for iron, white for sulphur, green for copper, yellow for uranium, and so on.
The pH level measures 4.6: within the range for acid rain (neutral water has a pH level of 7). The figure for Total Dissolved Solids (a measure of minerals, metals and other insoluble materials), meanwhile, is 2,000 parts per million  four times higher than the guideline amount in the US .

When it floods, this just goes straight into the river. Youd expect the government to check that the mine water isnt spilling into local watercourses, but they are not, van Wyk says. This is happening in the centre of South Africas largest city, close to the Department of Environmental Affairs s main office. If they cant regulate so close to their headquarters, just imagine how bad it is elsewhere?
A few miles away, the township of Diepkloof in Soweto catches the run-off from several large tailings. A few hundred feet from residents front doors, a run-off canal has burst its banks. A hardened white wasteland now stands where reeds and plants used to grow. A lifeless stream runs next to it. The soils surface, meanwhile, is scuffed with the imprint of cattle hoofs and childrens feet. The soil has a pH of 2.67  more acidic than vinegar.
Just downstream, an evangelical church carries out full-immersion baptisms in the water, points out Charles van der Merme, a representative of the non-profit Mining and Environmental Justice Community Network of South Africa . They think they are cleansing themselves, he says. Who knows? Perhaps it kills all the devils in you.

Bench Marks does not currently have a Geiger counter, but even the Chamber of Mines of South Africa admits that radioactive contamination is a major problem.
Five years ago, the government identified 36 priority areas affected by radioactive acid mine drainage for remediation . Today, not a single one of these sites has a feasible implementation strategy in place. According to the Cancer Association of South Africa , the health of up to 400,000 people could be affected.
Its totally inappropriate that communities live on waste that is widely accepted to be toxic and radioactive, says Mariette Liefferink, chief executive of the Federation for a Sustainable Environment .

According to the Chamber of Mines, all current re-mining meets regulations that prohibit radioactive contamination run-off. The problem lies instead with the owners of historic dumps that cannot be traced or are not in a position to take responsibility for the required remedial measures, the industry body states.
For its part, DRD Gold, which is currently involved in secondary gold mining of the Diepkloof tailing, says it is constantly searching for new methods of dust suppression. Among the measures it is currently using are netting and vegetation growth . Neither were visible on the Diepkloof dump, however.
According to the company, DRD Gold spends up to R48m (2.5m) a year managing the environmental impacts of its operations, which stretch over 70km around the city. Any [pollution] readings that exceed the legal limits are automatically flagged and managed in terms of an automated action list, a company spokesperson stated.
For those living in the shadow of the dumps, a sense of hopelessness pervades. Sixty-two-year-old Stella Adams, a long-term resident of Diepkloof, has written to numerous government departments to complain about the high levels of dust in her home. All I am asking for is some vegetation [on the tailing]. I am just asking for the most basic thing, she says. But nobody has ever given me a hearing  so I have lost hope.

Adamss grandson developed asthma shortly after moving into her home six years ago. Her sister recently died from lung cancer, despite never having smoked. Adams assumed the cancer was hereditary, so made no mention to doctors of the nearby tailing. Now I wonder if it had to do with the mine after all.
As well as cancer, high radioactive levels are linked to other health risks such as Parkinsons disease, Alzheimers, neurotoxic syndromes and growth deficiencies. Even so, residents in Johannesburgs poor townships have little choice but to stick it out.
In the Soweto district of Meadowlands, for example, hundreds of government-built houses are currently going up in the Fleurhof extension community. Mine dumps tower above the development on all sides. Yet, despite knowing the dangers, 41-year-old Charles van der Merme says he would move there in a flash.
One of the millions of unemployed residents in this city of 4.8 million, he and his family currently live with his parents-in-law in the township of Riverlea. I applied for a government house in 2000 and Im still homeless, van der Merme says. Despite all the ills from the mine dumps, I would like a house of my own. Where else can I go?

        <title>The human cost of the Tbilisi floods: 'The truth is, I'd really lost all hope'</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jul/03/tbilisi-floods-georgia-capital-destroyed-zoo-wild-animals</Link>

While viewers around the world were entranced by TV images of wild animals wandering free in the streets of Tbilisi, residents of the Georgian capital faced up to the human and material cost of the floods that hit on 13 June. The flooding, which left 19 people dead and caused damage put at $50 million (32m), was the biggest natural disaster to befall the city in living memory.
With the painful and slow cleanup operation still ongoing, Tbilisis residents are now asking whether this disaster was a freak, unpredictable occurrence  or whether its location and history of poor urban planning has left this city of 1.1 million people more vulnerable than they had realised.
Georgias environment minister, Gigla Agulashvili, stands on the edge of the Tskneti-Betania road in the hills above Tbilisi . This is the site where, during a night of exceptionally heavy rains, up to a million cubic metres of earth slid down the cliff into the Vere valley, sending a massive torrent of mud and tree trunks storming into the heart of the city.
About 60% of the land mass remains on the hillside, Agulashvili tells me. A lawyer by education, the minister of the environment has become intimately familiar with the geology of the city since the disaster struck. In heavy rains it could start to move again  but were not expecting such huge precipitation in the near future.

Behind where the minister is speaking, the ground has fallen away into a gaping pit of rocks, earth and broken trees that goes on for four kilometres. In the distance, a group of geology students huddles around a ministry official who is elucidating the workings of a new landslide early-warning system being installed in the area.
Within minutes of the Vere river breaking its banks, the flood waters had filled Keti Kurashvilis first-floor apartment up to 25cm from the ceiling. She made a narrow escape by forcing open the front door and clinging to the iron bars on the window. I just kept thinking, how can I die in all this mud? A dead dog floated up to me and touched my legs, but I kicked it with my foot and the current took it away.
Sitting with her granddaughter in her hotel accommodation, Kurashvili pauses half way through her story and starts to cry. In the corner of the room, donations of food and clothing are stuffed into thin plastic bags. To tell you the truth, Id really lost all hope, she says. I thought: OK, thats it  its over.
Generally, were seeing post-traumatic stress, anxiety and extreme neurosis, says psychotherapist Maia Begashvili, wearily drawing on a cigarette in the lobby of the modest hotel that is temporarily housing Kurashvili and other homeless flood victims. Along with her colleagues from the local mental health NGO Dendroni, Begashvili has been providing free visits to displaced families since the floods hit. Given the extent of the trauma, she says, she expects to be working with some of the children for at least a year.

The citys authorities have faced criticism for the lack of an emergency response plan
Begashvili lists the problems facing those who have lost their homes: The change in living space, the change in economic situation, the change in social environment ... this is all stressful, she says. Its hard for them to get over it. If they dont get treatment, they could develop the clinical symptoms of various illnesses.
The citys authorities have faced criticism for not having an emergency response plan in place. Some have pointed out they could have at least closed the Vere valley road upon hearing about the massive landslide outside the city. Others have accused the emergency services of responding slowly to the incident. When I first rang the emergency number, no one was there, Kurashvili tells me, and when I called again later, there was still no answer. Do you call that prepared?
Many of those affected are asking why they were not told about the risks of living close to the Vere river  which, for most of the year, is no more than a shallow stream. Much of the criticism is focused on the construction tunnels built to channel the river around the zoo from 1960s onwards. Further tunnels, built under a new arterial road in the Vere valley in 2012, became clogged with debris during the flooding, directing the surging flood waters towards adjacent residential areas.
When they built tunnels around the area of the zoo, even after the floods in the 1960s, its clear the wrong decisions were made, Agulashvili says. They kept building these tunnels and illegally issuing building permits to private individuals without considering the risks.
The future of Tbilisis zoo itself hangs in the balance. According to the zoos director, about half of the animals died in the flooding, and those that survived or were rescued from the citys streets are being housed in enclosures on higher ground.
The location of the zoo in a river valley next to several major intersections was long questioned by animal rights campaigners, but plans to relocate the zoo were dropped after a change of government in 2012. The billionaire businessman and former prime minister, Bidzina Ivanishvili, has offered to finance the zoos move to a new location outside of the city, but there have also been calls for it to be scrapped altogether.

Svanidze Street in the citys Vake district was the first populated area to be hit by the flood. Here, the full force of the deluge hit homes built on cheap land next to the river 50 or so years ago. Absolutely nothing is left, says Murman Chanturashvili as he sorts pieces of broken furniture and sodden books into piles, ready to be removed by the soldiers and volunteers that are cleaning this area.
Chanturashvilis first-floor flat is caked with mud up to the ceiling and in places, the soaked parquet floor bulges underfoot. Fortunately, his wife was in Moscow at the time of the flood with their grandchildren. We were up to our necks in mud. Even the things I can wash down are useless now. Basically, everything was destroyed.
Not quite everything. Picking through the kitchen, Chanturashvili finds that his stash of homemade wine  sealed in plastic bottles and large glass jars in the cellar  are untouched. Smiling, he rinses the mud off one of the bottles with a hose outside and offers it as a present. Wine is a big deal in Georgia: a tangible link to their fertile land, their unique culture and their deep roots. Despite having to start almost from scratch, Chanturashvili is adamant that he wants to stay here.
What should I be afraid of? he asks. This house has been here for 40 years and nothing like this has happened before. Whoever thinks this place it at risk, let him think so! Our parents lived here and our children will be fine here too.
Poor urban-planning has turned Tbilisi into a city where further disaster is just waiting to happen

Experts, however, maintain that there are still significant risks. Geologist Claudio Margottini is a Unesco expert and vice-president of the International Consortium on Landslides. Since the flooding, he has been working with the Georgian Ministry of Environment Protection to assess the immediate risk to the city and develop a long-term plan of action.
Although the amount of rain that fell on the night of June 13 was rare, Margottini says that global climate change is making these extreme weather events more and more frequent. In the long-term, the city needs to develop a land-use plan taking into account maximum precipitation. This needs to be the basis of future town planning, in order to reduce the impact of these phenomena.
While officials are keen not to exaggerate the risks of future flooding, for many residents, poor urban-planning has turned Tbilisi into a city where further disaster is just waiting to happen.
Tamriko Kadagidze rushed to help when she saw the disaster unfold on Svanidze Street from her nearby apartment. In other parts of the city, theyre pulling down trees and cutting through cliffs to build apartment blocks, she says. If they keep doing this, the same kind of disaster could hit us again.

        <title>Making sense of Miami: what America's refuge city says about the US's future</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jul/02/miami-florida-cuba-multicultural-metropolis-diversity-hispanic-haiti</Link>
        <Description/>

Just off Miamis busy Calle Ocho, the thoroughfare that is the beating cultural heart of the citys Cuban community, there rises a splendid ceiba tree whose roots erupt from the ground like waves from the sea, and whose vast branches throw shade far to either side.
All around the gnarled roots and tucked into the trees hidden crevices, one finds the offerings of the faithful: candles, bags of food, feathers, bones. In this modern metropolis, whose vaulting skyscrapers a mile away reflect the near-blinding sun, the saturnalia surrounding the ceiba attests to the lifeblood of the Afro-Cuban religion of santera, and Miamis eternal place in the imagination of el exilio, as the Cuban community is often referred to.
Ive lived in Miami off and on since the mid-1990s. As much as anywhere in the United States  my native country with which I have an often conflicted relationship  it counts as home. Landing back in Florida from Haiti, Paris or elsewhere, Miami always seems to offer the singular trick of providing some of the efficiency and convenience of living in the US while never seeming entirely a part of it.
Miami has long been a kind of quasi city-state that evokes strong reactions from visitors, especially those from more anglicised parts of the country who cannot make themselves understood in English to a large part of the local population  an experience that annoys and alarms them.
The strangest city in what is perhaps Americas strangest state, Miami is now home not just to Cubans but to thousands of Argentines, Brazilians, Colombians, Haitians, Jamaicans, Mexicans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans and practically every other Latin American nationality, with sizeable populations of Russians, Indians, Persians and Orthodox Jews as well.

The city has become so micronised that what is commonly thought of as Miami in the popular imagination is, in fact, a series of semi-independent small cities  some only a few blocks long  within the urban sprawl of Miami-Dade County (population 2.6 million). It fronts a long sweep of the blue-green Atlantic to the east and finally peters out in the miasma of the Everglades swamp to the west and the necklace of the Florida Keys to the south.
A young city (it was only incorporated in 1896 in what was then mostly wilderness), Miami is often said to have been founded on bootleg liquor and built its skyline on an infusion of cocaine money in the 70s and 80s (at the height of its cocaine wars in 1980 to 1981, the city had the worlds highest murder rate). Nearly 30 years ago, the crime writer Edna Buchanan wrote that Miami had been a sleepy resort that had transformed to attract year-round ... concentrations of everything corrupt, bizarre or dangerous from everywhere in the world.
Above all, Miami is a place of exile where newcomers try to construct a new life. Upon arriving from Cuba in 1980, the author Reinaldo Arenas  who as a teenaged barbudo had fought with Castros forces but was then imprisoned and tortured both for being an independent intellectual and gay  declared Miami a barren and pestiferous peninsula ... trying to become for a million exiles, the dream of a tropical island.
No fan of the city, Arenas quickly decamped to New York, where he committed suicide in 1990. Miami, however, continued to percolate like a spoonful of Caf Bustelo coffee from the cafe colada that residents traditionally drink every afternoon at 3:05 (the citys area code). And it has become something more interesting than many had thought possible.

In his office in West Miami near the citys airport  a few blocks away from a branch of the citys El Palacio de los Jugos Cuban eateries where the pan con lechn hints at the divine  Armando Valladares sits surrounded by photos of himself with political leaders: Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush, Florida senator (and Miami native and presidential candidate) Marco Rubio. Now white-haired, bespectacled and elegant, Valladares spent 22 years in Cuban prisons for  among other perceived offences  refusing to put an Im with Fidel sign on his desk at the Ministry of Communications in 1960. Upon his release in 1982, he became a United States Ambassador to the United Nations. After residing in Washington for many years, he moved to Miami about 15 years ago.
The Cubans have demonstrated their ability and their quality of work here, Valladares says. Its a unique case in the history of the United States where the identity of a city was born, in a sense, in another country.
The Cuban aspects of Miamis identity appear to be far less monolithic than they once were, though. Many younger Cuban-Americans support the easing of relations with Cuba that US president Barack Obama has been pursuing with the islands rulers. Events such as the O Miami poetry festival bring Cuban cultural groups such as Omni Zona Franca (from eastern Havanas housing estates) to Miami on a regular basis, demonstrating that the citys Latin vibe is more than Hoy Como Ayer (Today Like Yesterday), as one long-standing club wistfully calls itself.

If Miami represents a refuge for Cubans, it serves as no less of one for Haitians who, fleeing a downward economic spiral and the tyranny of some of the countrys leaders, have made a profound impact on Miamis cultural life over the last several decades.
Along a once-neglected stretch of Northeast 2nd Avenue in the heart of the Haitian immigrant community, a cultural flowering has taken place that has seen the opening of the Little Haiti Cultural Center and its Caribbean Marketplace  a replica of the famed March en fer (Iron Market) in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince . Exuberantly coloured murals by local artists adorn walls, and every Friday night the Rara Lakay band marches through the neighbourhood , beating on drums and blowing on plangent bamboo vaksin trumpets, whose bleat more evokes the deep Haitian countryside than an American city.
I have seen this city grow culturally, says the Haitian painter Edouard Duval Carri , who arrived in Miami from Paris in 1992. When I moved here it was really a [cultural] desert. That has changed.

Carri maintains his studio in Little Haiti. Famous for his painting of Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier in a wedding dress (an image that did not endear him to the regime), his space now seems a precursor of the areas renaissance. What was once a district many outsiders approached with trepidation now attracts hundreds of people to the outdoor concerts of its monthly Big Night in Little Haiti .
This is the doorway to the United States, Carri says. The particularity of Miami is that it has this very ebullient immigration that makes it quite fascinating.
But Miamis growth into the multicultural metropolis it is today has had a sinister side, too. In the 1960s, the city built the southern extension of Interstate 95 directly through the heart of the Overtown district, an area that had been a cultural mecca for black culture in the south. Overtown was a very pleasant place, says Enid Pinkney, the 83-year-old daughter of an immigrant from the Bahamas (one of the first non-indigenous communities to settle in Miami).
Dispersed to other areas of the city, black residents often found themselves met with hostility. After the 1980 acquittal of four white and Latino police officers for the murder of black businessman Arthur McDuffie, at least 18 people died in rioting and property destruction topped $100m. Fatal police shootings touched off riots in the city at three other points during that decade.
Police departments throughout the county gained a reputation for violence and corruption that intervening years have done little to diminish, with Miami Beach police famously fatally tasering teenage Colombian-American graffiti artist Israel Hernandez in 2013. That same year, a report by the US Justice Department found that City of Miami police had  engaged in a pattern or practice of excessive use of force through officer-involved shootings in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution and that the department was tainted by deficient tactics, improper actions by specialised units, as well as egregious delays and substantive deficiencies in deadly force investigations.

Outside observers often remain mystified by Miami. Three years ago, the author Tom Wolfe attempted to capture it as he had 1980s New York in The Bonfire of the Vanities , and instead spewed forth a right-wing caricature titled Back to Blood that showed no grasp of the place the city has become. Such misconceptions are helped along by gaffe- and scandal-prone local politicians, whose peccadillos include everything from floating the idea to shut down all the citys libraries to close a budget gap, to the by-now standard (for Miami) cash-for-favours schemes.
In some areas, things have gone over the top. In South Beach  once a slum for retirees and poor immigrants, now a gay mecca and nightlife hotspot  crass commercialisation has resulted in a kind of Vegas-by-the-sea ambiance, with even the famed Lincoln Road, once a redoubt of local restaurants and retailers, now housing little more than chain stores and the bewildered tourists they prey upon. The preponderance of juniors (a derisive term for the rich scions of Latin Americas economic elite) in the city can be somewhat off-putting, as it seems not only the language and music of that elite is being imported, but their class system, as well.
The city has blossomed and has a new cultural heritage
But the city has blossomed from the place that Reinaldo Arenas despised. The great Cuban poet and anthropologist Lydia Cabrera , who was during her lifetime one of the worlds foremost authorities on Afro-Cuban religion, spent the latter part of her life based in Miami, and donated her abundant collection of papers to the university here. It was home, too, for one of Haitis greatest poets, Flix Morisseau-Leroy , for the last 17 years of his life. And, as testament to the citys new cultural heritage, a new major institution, the Prez Art Museum Miami , opened next to the waters of Biscayne Bay in 2013; the Art Basel festival attracts thousands to the city every year; and the Miami Book Fair is an autumn staple of the literary calendar.
Perhaps more representative of the city than South Beach today are the northern reaches of Miami Beach, an area that is still home to many working-class residents despite spiralling property prices, where the lilting, almost Italianate sound of Argentine Spanish mixes with the caressing sounds of Brazilian Portuguese in the bodegas and on the beach. The Buenos Aires Bakery &amp; Cafe  an establishment on Collins Avenue, only steps away from the sea  sells a variety of pastries that would make any porteo misty-eyed with nostalgia as well as several different kinds of the leafy, highly caffeinated mate beloved in South America, and does a brisk business.

When one drives south towards the Florida Keys  where the last island, Key West, is a mere 90 miles from Cuba  the county begins to descend into farmland. It was here that, in the early part of the 20th century, a Latvian-born eccentric named Edward Leedskalnin created an extraordinary structure known as the Coral Castle , out of coral-formed limestone. As he worked alone and without advanced equipment, just how Leedskalnin created his castle remains something of a mystery  with explanations ranging from some secret mastery of the Earths magnetic field to telekinesis.
Today, other dreams are played out in Miami-Dades fields, and exist in the imaginings of the many migrant workers who toil here, scant miles from the glittering high-rises of downtown Miami. Surrounded by fields of squash, okra, beans and tomatoes, the community of Homestead, despite its tropical locale, evokes the somnolent Midwestern communities of a Ray Bradbury story. Low-rise buildings, train tracks and empty playground swings greet the visitor, and in the street one hears the melange of accents and dialects from the agricultural workers here: Mexican, Guatemalan, Haitian, Jamaican.
In the offices of the immigrant support group WeCount! just off of North Krome Avenue (which shares its name with one of the USs most infamous immigration detention centres located nearby), the connection between Homesteads rural lushness and the city rising only a few miles away seems obvious.
The Mexicans are the ones that put the food on Miamis table, says Catalina Santiago, an 18-year-old high school student who came to the US with her agricultural-worker parents from the Mexican state of Oaxaca a decade ago. But they are always spoken of in a condescending manner.
Related: Miami, the great world city, is drowning while the powers that be look away
On the street below, where Santiago sits with her brother and a number of other immigrants, dusk falls and Homestead sees Mexican families gathering for Sunday-night dinner at restaurants such as Casita Tejas. When they rise for work early the following morning, some will be met by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and local police, who will be waiting to check their immigration status and arrest them for probable deportation if they are undocumented (as many are, a state of affairs on which Floridas agriculture depends).
Perhaps it is impending apocalypse, natural and man-made, that makes Miamis frivolity all the more poignant. If climate change predictions are to be believed, large parts of Miami  Miami Beach, Key Biscayne, Virginia Key  will be under water in coming years, a phenomenon helped along by the fact that many Florida politicians, including Governor Rick Scott and the aforementioned Senator Rubio, deny that climate change can be linked to human activity.
Driving home north along US1, the skyline of Miami rises above the flat land, its concrete and steel wrapped in the warmth of the tropical sunset. A city of outsiders, refugees and immigrants that  in its reflection of present-day Americas diversity  feels in many ways more American than the 1950s small-town Americana that some politicians and commentators are perpetually nostalgic for.

I was born in Calcutta, but we moved to Bombay when I was one and a half years old, maybe in early 1964. The company my father worked in had relocated its head office in the face of growing labour unrest; the move was part of the general egress of industry from the city.
We continued to visit Calcutta once, sometimes twice, a year. My mothers brother lived there with his family in Pratapaditya Road, in the historic neighbourhood of Bhowanipore, South Calcutta. He is a Jadavpur University graduate and German-trained civil engineer. By the time I got to know him as a child, hed abandoned his job and set out with friends, establishing a factory that made machines in Howrah, Calcuttas industrial district across the river Hooghly. Given the political turbulence of the 1960s, the business was a long-drawn-out failure. My uncle, however, never wavered from his faith in the Left.
In 1977, the Left Front was elected to form the government in the state of West Bengal; it then won eight successive elections until finally being voted out of power in 2011. The tenure of the Left in West Bengal was marked by genuine achievements and plenty of failures. Perhaps one of its legacies was to create a microcosm that was entirely out of tune with the free-market zeitgeist whose vanguard assumed power in other parts of the world soon after the Left came to power in Bengal: one thinks of Margaret Thatchers election victory in 1979, and Ronald Reagans in 1981. India itself embraced free-market deregulation in 1991. Of course, theres no reason why Bengal shouldnt have explored an alternative path on its own terms; its just that actual faith in what these terms might be was, by the 80s, lacking.
I learnt two things from my visits to Calcutta in the 1960s and 70s, and to my uncles house in particular. The first was that there was an alternative to the corporate world I inhabited in Bombay. Culture did not have to be anglophone to be exciting or sophisticated. In fact in India at that time, it seemed sophistication and excitement often lay outside the realm of the anglophone. Second, it appeared that culture and learning did not have to be exclusive to privileged, stable or well-to-do lives. In my uncles house, the opposite seemed true: the energy I encountered in it as a child was a remnant of a cultural and political force-field that began to come into existence in the city in the 19th century.
My uncle's house contained an interior narrative whose echoes I'd discover later in other parts of the world

This house was the only piece of property my uncle owned, and it had been gifted to him by his father-in-law. My family came from Sylhet, now in Bangladesh, and theyd lost whatever land or property they might have owned with Partition. This was one of the reasons I never associated the sort of house of my uncle lived in with privilege. Also, Pratapaditya Road had become a slightly disturbed and down-at-heel area by the 1960s. Nevertheless, the house itself contained space and life, and an interior narrative whose echoes Id discover later in other parts of the world, but never their exact prototype.
These were the houses features: a porch on the ground floor; red oxidised stone floors; slatted Venetian or French-style windows painted green; round knockers on doors; horizontal wooden bars to lock doors; an open rooftop terrace; a long first-floor verandah with patterned cast-iron railings; intricately worked cornices; and ventilators the size of an open palm, carved as intricate perforations into walls. (Some houses built in the 1940s also incorporate perky art-deco elements: semi-circular balconies; a long, vertical strip comprising glass panes for the stairwell; porthole-shaped windows; and the famous sunrise motif on grilles and gates.)
My uncles house no longer stands. It came down as part of the property boom that happened in Calcutta in the 1990s, in anticipation of the Left Front governments resolve to bring industry to Bengal  a belated stirring of ambition arising from a desire not to miss out on the apparent benefits of economic deregulation that were transforming cities like Bombay, Delhi, Chennai and Bangalore. The destruction of these houses would also be a consequence of the house-owners inability to maintain property in an economically depressed city.
Industry never came, partly because of the complex issue of land acquisition as well as the insurmountable populism of West Bengals politics. But existing houses and neighbourhoods continued to be destroyed because of the ethos created by developers  a euphemism, often, for a new breed of land sharks. This ethos dictated that houses on prime land needed to be bought up and immediately destroyed for the price of the land they stood on. So the houses were never put on the market, and their market value was never determined.

Among the principal candidates for buying the new condos were non-resident Indians: Bengalis settled abroad, mainly in America. They never thought to purchase these houses to live in, though they would, of course, be open to buying such houses to inhabit in London, Marrakech or Goa. Family-owned houses that could no longer be maintained were, meanwhile, frequently sold to developers by non-resident Indians.
Soon, the near-simultaneous purchase and destruction of a house seemed like an inevitability. So, paradoxically, did the acquisition of the accoutrements of globalisation: industry and investment didnt come to Bengal, but the ancillary features of a deregulated economy  shopping malls, new five-star hotels, multiplexes, gated properties  began to adorn Calcutta.
These days, the prices of new properties here are fuelled mainly by speculation. This means that new housing is hardly a response to demand; its an invitation to investors whod previously have put their money in equity. Advertisements are a reliable integer of the desires of the new well-to-do: in Calcutta (officially Kolkata since 2001), adverts for gold jewellery  an attractive form of investment  are ubiquitous. Yet in the last 10 years, Id hazard a guess that these have been overtaken by adverts for apartments in tower blocks and improbably named (Highland Park, Diamond City ) gated enclaves. Rival newspapers carry full-page ads for the same construction on their front pages. Until 2013, property seemed a less volatile form of investment than the market.
But property prices in Calcutta have now reached a plateau, and the only people making money off new flats are developers and estate agents. In fact, they seem to be almost the only people making money in Calcutta at all. A newspaper report revealed two months ago that there has been a dramatic and counter-intuitive surge in dollar multimillionaires in this city. The report noted that nearly all of them were making money in real estate.

It was during my travels in Europe in the last 20 years that I realised the neighbourhoods we confront there not only represent the history that produced them, but a history involving communities resisting their disappearance . Without such resistance, no vestiges of the great urban churning of the last two centuries would remain in the world today  in Europe, Australia, the United States and even Latin America. Calcutta, too, was powerfully and uniquely a part of this urban churning (I say uniquely because the neighbourhoods and type of house Ive described above have echoes, but no counterpart, in any other city  in India or abroad).
When we speak of Calcuttas architecture, we usually mean the colonial institutions that the British erected, or the aristocratic mansions of North Calcutta (once called the Black Town by the English) built by Bengali landowners. But the houses Im speaking of were built by anonymous builders for middle-class Bengali professionals: lawyers, doctors, civil servants and professors. Theyre to be found throughout the city, from north to south, in Bhowanipore, Sarat Bose Road, Lake Road, Southern Avenue, Hindustan Park, Bakul Bagan, Paddapukur, Kidderpore, Ahiritola and more.
They all possess the family resemblances Ive enumerated above, to do with slatted windows, cornices, open rooftops and red floors. What is remarkable, though, is that no two houses are identical: a house with a broad facade might stand next to a thin house, both sharing various characteristics  and there are many other ways in which each house you encounter is a fresh conjuring-up or experiment. This makes for an unprecedented, sui generis variety in a single lane or neighbourhood; a variety I have seen nowhere else (think, in contrast, of the identical Victorian houses on a London street). And the style  which can only be described as Bengali-European  is neither renaissance (hardly any Corinthian pillars, as you might spot in the North Calcutta villas) nor neo-Gothic (as Bombays colonial buildings are) nor Indo-Saracenic, which expresses a utopian idea of what a mish-mash of Renaissance, Hindu and Moghul features might be. Its a style that is, to use Amartya Sen s word, eccentric and beautiful, and entirely the Bengali middle classs.

Old is a misnomer for these buildings: theyre the products of the new Calcutta, the Calcutta of modernity and modernism that arose in the 19th century and took on a new identity in the 20th; a Calcutta that evaded, became a counterpoint to, took from, and was far richer than both the British-created city and any idea of the Black Town.
In a way, many of these buildings, which came up from the early 20th-century onwards, testify to why Calcutta continued to be a political, and especially a cultural, hub in India long after the British took away its status as capital city to contain its revolutionary nationalism in 1911  and even a century after the Renaissance, the efflorescence in Bengali culture in the middle of the 19th century. Its this Calcutta whose buildings are poised to vanish, and whose survival some of us are arguing for. Two letters were sent in May to the chief-minister of West Bengal: one signed by 15 people who cut across party lines and persuasions; the other by Amartya Sen, addressed to me and written in support of the project.
Among the ideas that have been put to the government is that of transfer of development rights  which would see a house-owner sell the developer rights equivalent to the price of the land on which his or her house stands, which could then be used by the developer to extend constructions to a commensurate value in another location. Whether or not this model will work cannot be ascertained unless its adopted.
The letter also refers to the MIT economist Esther Duflos observation  glaringly obvious to the outsider who knows a bit about Calcuttas cultural history, but perhaps not so to the resident who is inured to their city  that, properly showcased, these neighbourhoods (Duflo compares them to Pragues) could make Calcutta a tourist destination, and bring it the revenue it so badly needs. The ensuing danger of gentrification is a real one, but a fine line divides it from genuine cultural reinvention.
The basic aims of our campaign are these: first, to work towards and arrive at a working solution, however improbable this seems; second, to find new ways of looking at, and discussing whats important about, these houses and neighbourhoods. Although it would appear that the problem needs to be addressed primarily by the heritage commissions in the city, its also clear that heritage, as a notion and definition, is part of the problem.
In Calcutta, 'heritage' means we cease to engage with the architectural individuality and difference of buildings

In Calcutta, a heritage building is a landmark that is important for either being a significant institutional building, or because a famous person frequented it or lived there. The architectural distinctiveness of the building is a secondary concern, or is a pre-ordained, generic feature of the structure: that is, we already know it qualifies as a heritage structure because it adheres to our idea of what a heritage colonial building looks like.
In Calcutta, heritage means we cease to engage with the architectural individuality and difference of buildings and precincts. We dont periodise, falling back on catch-all terms like colonial; or historicise; or describe; or define. Simply put, heritage means we dont see, or think about, buildings. (And yet, even as a rubric to be blindly followed, heritage is ignored astonishingly in Calcutta: iconic peoples houses are unmarked and repeatedly destroyed; grade-A listed structures are torn down.)
In July, Mamata Banerjee, the chief-minister of West Bengal, whose government succeeded the Left Fronts in 2011, will make her first trip to London. It will be an intriguing event, as Ms Banerjees fascination with the British capital is well-known, and has caused mirth in the past. On assuming power, one of her first startling remarks had to do with her desire to turn Calcutta into London. She clarified later that what she meant was that both cities had grown alongside rivers, and that Calcutta could do much more with its riverfront.
If she studies her surroundings on this trip, shell discover that Calcutta doesnt actually look very much like London. The main reason has to do with the two cities notably different architectural styles: Londons elegant Victorian, Gothic, Georgian and Edwardian buildings (jealously protected from destruction, on the whole, by conservation laws) are shaped by a distinct Puritanism very unlike the slatted, openness-loving, loiterer-friendly Bengali-European style of, say, Bhowanipore. This disjunction is another reminder of why Calcuttas neighbourhoods cant be reduced to colonial history, and must be understood in terms of their own peculiar, cross-referencing cosmopolitanism.
Related: The Writers' Building, Kolkata: a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 13
To move on this matter hasnt been easy, and not only because of governmental inaction and the absence of actual powers where the West Bengal Heritage Commission and the Kolkata Municipal Corporations Heritage Committee are concerned. Whats more difficult is peoples inability to recognise the architectural legacy theyve taken for granted for more than a century, and their mysterious disconnect from the history that produced these neighbourhoods.
This is the reason I provided the short personal note at the beginning: to explain my outsiders point of view. It may be why I see these buildings as I do, without that special Bengali nostalgia that expresses itself, generically, in songs by Bangla bands and in recent Bengali films, which occasionally conflate North Calcutta and any one of its decaying mansions with a sentimental idea of the citys true heritage. Theres a certain quietism, a sweet apathy, in such nostalgia that I feel even more distant from than the moral superiority Ive had to confront from people who feel this architecture is too minor and remote an issue for intelligent people to be concerned with.
Whats at stake here is a discussion on urban regeneration  which is connected to, but distinct from, economic revival. For the urban revival of any city, its a prerequisite that citizens engage with the spaces, buildings and histories that characterise it, rather than deny those features; that they understand and reuse them. Calcutta, in the last two decades, has largely failed to do this. But the narrative of every great city must contain such episodes of failure, before it begins to look at itself anew.

From Waze for crowds to Uber for street food  MIT innovations at Kumbh Mela
For the spiritual among the 30 million people descending on the Indian city of Nashik for this Augusts tri-annual Hindu festival, the event is a catharsis. For urban planners it is an opportunity to analyse city problems on a huge scale

This August an expected 30 million religious devotees, ascetics and tourists will congregate in the Indian city of Nashik for the Kumbh Mela  a 20-day Hindu festival which is one of the largest public gatherings in the world.
The mass pilgrimage of faith takes place every three years on a rotational basis in four alternating cities, and will be returning to Nashik after a gap of 12 years. For the spiritual, the event is a catharsis, where one can purge oneself of sin by taking a dip in the holy water of the sacred rivers. But for technologists, social innovators and urban planners, the staggering increase in human density is a golden opportunity to identify, analyse and study pop-up city problems at scale.
Ramesh Raskar, who spearheads the Massachusetts Institute of Technologys Kumbhathon venture, is head of MITs Camera Culture group, conducting multidisciplinary research in optics, sensors, probes and software processing. The Kumbhathon was conceived as a sandbox initiative to create a prototype ecosystem with the broader vision of game-changing innovation at its core, he explains. The challenges of the 2015 Kumbh Nashik will be mapped to help address similar issues in refugee camps, concerts such as Burning Man in the Nevada desert and in emerging cities across the world.
The Kumbhathon project is at the vanguard of tradition and technology
Ramesh Raskar, MIT
Raskar worked with local innovators, students, city officials, civic groups, the police and historians in his hometown of Nashik to draw up a shortlist of key concerns, from a list of more than 500 issues received through an open crowdsourced platform, for the team to address. The project is at the vanguard of tradition and technology, said Raskar.
Over the past year, the Kumbhathon team has held three-monthly workshops and innovation camps to discuss, test and implement a range of smart solutions  from the hi-tech to the decidedly low-tech  to address challenges in the areas of access to healthcare, transportation, food and sanitation, housing and crowd control.

One hi-tech idea is an app to manage crowds and avoid stampedes  a regular problem at the festival, with at least 39 people killed in a stampede in 2003, the last time Nashik was host city. Modelled on the lines of the worlds largest community-based real time traffic and navigation app, Waze, the app uses mobile phone location data to help local police redirect pedestrians away from saturated areas.
Meanwhile, an online platform, LiveNashik, will dynamically gather and analyse data on taxis, train and bus schedules, free rooms in hostels, and the availability of hospital beds, ambulances and blood stocks. Within that citywide project, a person tracking app, called Milap, aims to address the major problem of children and others being lost during the frenzy of the festival. Under the scheme, individuals can be registered at entry points via a barcode that serves as an identification tool. If someone is lost, they can visit a store, where the shopkeeper can read their barcode with a smartphone  and a match with the missing persons database can be made.
Other hi-tech initiatives include the Epidemic Tracker, which is a combination of a mobile app and cloud-based backend analytical engine to monitor the health of festival attendees in real time. Not only does this serve as a check on potential outbreaks of disease, but also helps medics offer relevant prescriptions and medication.
However well constructed the technology, it depends on what society is ready to absorb and embrace
Tarun Khanna, Harvard
Another challenge being tackled is food distribution, where the team has devised an Uber -like logistical network that connects festival-goers with quality and hygienic food suppliers. This enables customers to have access to information about when and where the food was cooked and make more informed decisions about consumption. According to the Kumbhathon team, this model could be expanded into a multibillion-dollar nationwide service.
Its about tapping into smart citizens to make smart cities, said Raskar. Citizens watch more TV, carry smartphones and are highly mobile and connected. Their participation is crucial.

The ability of low-tech innovations to bring about greater social impact has been an eye-opening experience for the team. WikiNasik, is one such example, where more than 300 volunteers worked to update Nashiks Wikipedia page, so that outsiders had access to up-to-date and comprehensive information about the city. Students took cameras and used pictures to document the heritage and history of the city, said Raskar. Personal compilations can help enhance the experience for visitors and can also add value in the tourism sector in building an extensive city guide for the future, he added.
Another low-tech solution with high social outcome is a Shops Online portal that displays detailed information about retailers in the city. From specifics on the owner, the nature of the business and the hours of operation, to the location and a profile of the surrounding area, the platform could open up wide-ranging data-mining possibilities. The repository of data is key for potential investors who want to start a business during the Kumbh Mela.

While citizen participation on the ground in Nashik has been significant, the correlation between technology and the public acceptance of that technology must be kept in mind, according to Tarun Khanna, director of the South Asia Institute at Harvard University. As part of a team mapping the Allahabad Kumbh in 2013, he was surprised to find that a person-tracking app using photos wasnt as effective as the age-old solution of setting off a balloon in the air when a person was lost. However well constructed the technology, it all depends on what society is ready to absorb and embrace, he said.
Rahul Mehrotra, chair of the Urban Planning and Design department at Harvard, who led the venture for the Allahabad Kumbh, said that technology should not be considered a fix in itself. Cities are broader, more sensitive and more complex ecosystems in which technology is just one instrument and cannot be treated as an end in itself, he said.

If a city could embody a rainbow, it would be San Francisco . It is home both to the LGBT pride flag  which was first used in the citys 1978 Gay Freedom Day Parade  and a wealth of architecture and street art in multicolour.
For photographer Kristen Simar ( @home_schooling ), the character of the city is bound up with this multitude of colours. San Franciscos lifeblood is in its neighbourhoods. Each colourful house is a celebration of the citys history and the people who have chosen to call San Francisco home. No two houses are the same and each story is unique.
As the closest major city to Silicon Valley, the city has become the urban home of the tech scene, bringing with it a significant dose of gentrification  and change . San Francisco, historically home to trailblazing movements, has become a city of wealth, which has forced out many who cant keep up financially, including artists and activists. The old quirkiness and character is slowly being washed away, Kristen explains. Im trying to capture every bit of beauty, colour and individuality while its still there.

Spread of global conflict transforming humanitarian work, says Red Cross chief
Failure to find political solutions in areas of violent crisis is forcing ICRC to extend its core humanitarian remit, says organisations president Peter Maurer

The worlds inability to deal with the proliferation of conflict driven-crises is forcing the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to shoulder an ever-larger burden and reassess the way it works, the organisations president has warned.
Peter Maurer said the operational budget of the worlds oldest humanitarian organisation had risen by almost 50% over the past three years as it tried to keep pace with an extraordinary period of enduring humanitarian emergencies.
He said the failure to find political solutions to the ongoing violent crises in areas including the Middle East , sub-Saharan Africa and Ukraine had left the ICRC spending more than 1.5bn Swiss francs (1bn) a year as it  and other humanitarian organisations  tried to plug the gaps in the global response.
The international system is having difficulty getting to grips with those conflicts; countries have difficulty moving to consensus on how to deal with those crises, he said.
That seems to open spaces for disorder and conflict and we have those dynamics  which may be distinct and different in each and every country  but together they nevertheless refer us to an international system that does not seem to have international institutions with the ability to negotiate solutions to conflicts or to the big, increasing and accelerating impact of crises. Basically, it increases the necessity for us to respond.
Maurer pointed to Syria  which moved from internal civil unrest to a proxy war involving regional and global powers over the course of three-and-a-half years  as an example of the striking absence of political progress.
Isnt it a bit of a symbol that high-quality negotiators have not been able to move anything significant in the Syrian context? he said.
We had Kofi Annan and Lakhdar Brahimi and now we have Staffan de Mistura at the present moment, and they have tried bottom-down, top-up approaches, combinations of top-down and bottom-up; they have tried quiet, they have tried public; they have tried pressure, they have tried good will, and somehow there doesnt seem to be any political process that will turn the tide.
That lack of progress, he said, had left the ICRC and others scrabbling around for as big a plug as possible to try to contain a regional humanitarian crisis. Elsewhere  in rural Afghanistan , Ukraines Donbass region, Lake Chad , northern Nigeria and southern Niger  he said the organisation was in a very lonely situation as it operates where few do because of the difficulties of negotiating access.
Even the provision of medical assistance, which had previously been uncontroversial and accepted, was proving increasingly difficult in conflicts involving many different parties and against a backdrop of rising attacks on medical staff and facilities.
Maurer said the volume, complexity and duration of the current emergencies was forcing the ICRC to re-examine the mechanics and aims of its responses.
We still have a strong commitment to our original mission, which is to protect and assist people who are suffering from the impact of violence, but the violence has changed its character, format and pattern so that we are now responding year after year, he said.
I think we are challenged in how we define humanitarian action today and how we relate to long-term needs. We are also confronted with legitimate expectations from the people who want us to respond far more thoroughly to their basic pleas than we would have done in a much more contained form of conflict.
Maurer said that a recent trip to Maiduguri , the northeastern Nigerian city at the heart of the Boko Haram Islamist insurgency, had also led him to consider whether the ICRC should extend its core humanitarian remit to include the provision or facilitation of education.
I saw 500,000 displaced persons  a lot of them kids, he said. For the second year running, they are not going to school and they are in camps where there are no educational facilities. Each day that passes without kids being able to go to school is an enormous burden on the future.
Given that the ICRC are the only ones there and could not help with schooling, said Maurer, perhaps the time had come to try working with others in an attempt to ensure a basic level of education.
We may not do it ourselves, but if we cant provide some structure for an organisation to come and do it, they wont come, he said. And if they dont come, we will have to do it ourselves or we will fail. Its a completely different humanitarian need. Maybe we will have to slowly walk our way into that territory without necessarily already knowing how we do it from one conflict to another.
Maurer said he was acutely aware that a move into education could jeopardise the ICRCs much-valued reputation for neutrality. Boko Harams name means western education is forbidden.
We will certainly have to do a sober assessment in order to retain what is critical for our basic operation. I wouldnt immediately give up and say, This is just much too political and we will never do it, or we will never have a partnership with someone who does it.
It was, he added, one of the many dilemmas now facing humanitarian organisations at a time when a record 59.5 million people have been forced from their homes by war, violence and persecution .
While conflicts have expanded and deepened and transformed, actors have transformed and humanitarian assistance is transforming, he said. Protection work is transforming and taking on another character.

Britains Department for International Development (DfID) has broadly succeeded in implementing a new law measuring the impact of its overseas aid on reducing gender inequality, establishing a lead on integrating gender into humanitarian efforts that other international donors should follow, according to a report .
The study, by the Great Initiative and Plan UK , analysed information drawn from 44 projects  a mixture of business cases for development aid and approved humanitarian assistance  since the International Development (Gender Equality) Act came into effect in May last year.
The act places a duty on the government to consider ways in which development and humanitarian funding will build gender equality in the countries receiving aid.

The report praised DfID for engaging in a meaningful way with the act and going beyond its legal obligations. It urged the British government to encourage other countries to make a similar binding commitment.
DfID is broadly compliant with the procedures it has defined for implementing the act  namely a clearly flagged statement in the business case outlining the impact on gender inequality, the report, which was launched on Tuesday, said.
The study advocated several improvements, suggesting that DfID should: focus on ensuring that all business cases have a clearly flagged statement of gender impact; increase the quality of gender analysis by, for instance, sharing good practice from gender-sensitive and gender-transformative programmes; and address issues of transparency.
The report also urged DfID to maintain a high level of political leadership and step up global advocacy around the act.
We were delighted to find that the act has both driven, and joined forces with, other measures to promote gender equality. At the time of our analysis (May 2015) 64% of the business cases in our sample contained a clear statement addressing gender impact and only 18% of business cases lacked this statement, the report said.
DfID had since explained why some cases lacked statements, the report said. Most of the gaps were due to political or commercial sensitivity, while two of the absent statements were in the process of being published.
However, the reports authors noted that transparency was still an issue.
DFID has some progress to make on transparency. Accessing information can be a challenge, it said, adding that this fell short of DfIDs commitments under the UK Aid Transparency Guarantee.
Another problem raised by the reports authors lay in ensuring gender analyses, carried out during project planning, were implemented in delivery.
DfID has had a strong initial focus on compliance, as we would expect in the first year since the act was passed, so there is little evidence yet available about the expectation on programme staff  and even less on delivery partners  to ensure a gender focus is maintained through programme delivery.
Launching the report, Mariella Frostrup, a founding trustee of the Great Initiative, said independent evaluations were important to shore up public support for UK aid.
Related: Gender equality is a founding value of the EU, so why the lack of progress? | Joanna Maycock
She highlighted one case study from the report  the DfID-funded upgrading and resurfacing of a road in western Uganda  as an example of the importance of a gender perspective. The project was scored as low relevance to gender because promoting equality was not its primary objective.
But it surprised us, and indeed it turned out to be one of the most transformative projects we found in our evaluation. It identifies womens land ownership, violence against women, womens employment and social norms and stereotypes as issues to be addressed. And it mandates that 25% of jobs on the project are reserved for women, that womens safety and security is guaranteed and that gender sensitisation and awareness projects are run alongside the actual construction, she said.
Projects like this give me hope that we can eliminate gender inequality, but only if we recognise it, and tackle it wherever and whenever we can. That is what the act mandates us to do.
Gender was already a priority for DfID before the passage of the act, the report said. In a June interview with the Guardian , Justine Greening, the international development secretary, described DfIDs focus on women and girls as relentless.
Greening said she was determined to continue the departments work on tackling female genital mutilation and child marriage over the next parliament  and in the negotiations over the sustainable development goals , which will replace the millennium development goals later this year.
A DfID spokesperson said the act had given extra ambition and focus to the departments efforts to improve the rights and wellbeing of girls and women.
The report makes clear that DfID has gone above and beyond the act and we will continue to push other countries to follow our lead, the spokesperson said.
Tanya Barron , chief executive of Plan UK, said in a statement that the report showed what could be achieved when gender equality became a mandatory consideration, not an optional tick box.
She urged the EU, the World Bank and the UN system to replicate what the UK had done, especially in this critical year when the development agenda for the next 15 years is being fine-tuned.
The stakes have never been higher, as the sustainable development goals , financing for development and climate change talks set the worlds course for the foreseeable future. This report provides the evidence we need to argue that gender should be at the heart of these agreements.

Tanzania accused of making laws on the hoof in 'Kafkaesque' curb on free speech

There is a strange pattern to interviews in Tanzania . People on the verge of offering information stop mid-flow, pause, and then say something along the lines of: I dont have the data or information on that.
It appears odd until you look at the bills that have been rushed through parliament in recent weeks, which activists and journalists say could turn Tanzania into one of Africas most repressive countries for freedom of speech.

Its not a coincidence. This is the year of elections, says Maria Sarungi Tsehai , founder of Change Tanzania, a social media citizen movement. The organisation campaigns against laws that threaten independent reporting and dissident voices in the lead-up to Octobers presidential and parliamentary elections.
A Cybercrimes Act , signed into law on 8 May, criminalises the sharing of information deemed false, deceptive, misleading or inaccurate, forces internet service and mobile phone providers to share users information without telling them, and allows police officers to search and seize equipment without much justification.
Maxence Melo, co-founder of JamiiForums  a news and social networking platform that has become Tanzanias top whistleblowing site  is extremely worried about the laws. Since the site was founded in 2006, he has been questioned 17 times, detained twice, received death threats and suffered a mysterious car accident.
But he has refused to divulge the sources of information posted online. In 2007, Jamii published details of a corrupt energy deal  known as the Richmond scandal  which led to the dissolution of the cabinet and resignation of the prime minister. The expos also brought Melos first arrest and interrogation.
Another energy scandal exposed by Jamii and subsequently picked up by newspapers led to further senior sackings and donor distrust in the shape of threats to withhold almost $500m (324.5m) in aid.
More trouble followed for Melo. They used to say: We are going to come with a law that will force you to give us whatever document [or] details we need, he says.
Diplomats and journalists have dubbed the Cybercrimes Act the Jamii bill. Some MPs have told Melo not to make a fuss about it until after the elections, saying it might be amended later.
After elections in 2011, Melo says, Jamii was made an enemy of the state by President Jakaya Kikwete, who publicly blamed the site for a 20% drop in voter support from 2007. On the other hand, opposition politicians  some of whom have had their dirty laundry aired  have accused Jamii of working for the government.
The deputy communications minister, January Makamba  who hopes to run for the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party this year, when Kikwete steps down after his second term  accused Jamii of favouring the opposition in the last ballot.
The fact that theyve been trying to shroud bills that are openly trying to curb the freedom of expression is ridiculous
Maria Sarungi Tsehai
Makamba says the Cybercrimes Act was not meant to prevent the exchange and drafting of information but to protect people from abuse, such as online fraud and bullying. Tanzania is one of the freest countries in Africa , he insists.
That diplomats are unable to find the final text of laws that have been passed is embarrassing for them, says Makamba, adding that the fact activists are struggling to see the drafts of others speaks volumes about their level of interest on the matter.
Tsehai couldnt disagree more. The fact that theyve been trying to shroud bills that are openly trying to curb the freedom of expression is ridiculous, she says. Id almost say its Orwellian, but I prefer Kafka.
The cybercrime law sits uneasily with Tanzanias membership of the open government partnership initiative , which is meant to make government business more transparent to citizens. Tanzania has a long tradition of official wariness of providing information and handling criticism.
Independent media only appeared 10 years ago, but really took off in the past five years with the proliferation of more than 800 newspapers. Many of these pop up at election time, with a clear political agenda. However, politicians quickly managed to buy or close outlets and, according to former journalists, encourage self-censorship.
Mobile phones have changed things. Jamii has more than a million followers on Facebook, 28 million mobile subscribers and up to 600,000 people using its online forum every day.
The people in power  are finding that they have to deal with the jungle, something they cant control, which is the internet, says Tsehai.
The Cybercrimes Act seeks to deal with the rambunctious new media by decreeing that anyone sending or receiving unsolicited messages can be penalised for sharing them, be it through text messages, Facebook or Twitter.
Tsehai fears the authorities will send some citizens to jail so that they can be examples for the people, and terrify them into policing their own thoughts.
Related: Tanzania energy scandal ousts senior politicians
Another law, the 2013 Statistics Act , also deters Tanzanians from using or quoting anything but official government figures and data. Jamiis plans to get citizens to post polling station reports in October is in jeopardy because the punishment for publishing false or misleading statistical information without lawful authorisation from the National Bureau of Statistics is a year in jail, a 10m shilling (3,246) fine, or both.
After attempting to plant moles among Jamiis staff, politicians are now offering to buy advertising at hugely inflated rates in an attempt to sway the sites owners. They would rather shut down a site that is growing at 25% a month than buy it.
I do not believe in money. I believe in people, says Melo, 39, whose phone buzzes all the time with requests to join the site or attempts by hackers to silence him. Jamii, who gave up a relatively lucrative civil engineering job to work for virtually nothing, uses profits from advertising mainly on paying the 50 staff who edit up to 50,000 comments a day.
Melo survives on four hours sleep a night, because he vets new users and verifies all the information before it goes up, to ensure Jamiis credibility and avoid legal problems.
That will become more difficult if other bills affecting the media are passed. Meanwhile, Melo and others fear an even bigger crackdown on dissenting voices. If Ive already been questioned 17 times [so far], Ill probably be questioned 100 times in a month because they want to get everything, they want to have everything.

The great strength of the millennium development goals was their ability to focus the minds of the development industry and, to some extent, governments on a handful of key priorities, such as child survival, basic education and womens rights.
But that was also their weakness. It inevitably meant that equally important themes were excluded, and, by extension, it meant the exclusion of those countries and constituencies for which these other themes were the main concerns.
So the oft-expressed critique that the sustainable development goals are too broad, and that we need a kind of MDG-plus agenda, is misplaced. We need this SDG agenda precisely because it brings in other issues, most obviously links to global environmental problems but also the economic and structural causes of the social issues emphasised by the MDGs.
Related: If we want to end poverty, we need to be able to measure it properly
Most important, perhaps, as I have argued , is that the SDGs overturn an embedded but old-fashioned paradigm: the idea that there are developing and developed countries. The SDGs will apply to all countries, not just a sub-group.
This inclusivity is one of the reasons that the SDGs could be a success. While the MDGs were resented by some countries as someone elses agenda, the SDGs are explicitly fully negotiated and agreed across the board.
If you wanted a list of priorities, then the SDGs are not for you. It is hard to think of a statement of intent by the worlds nations that is as comprehensive and visionary as the SDG agenda set to be acclaimed in New York in September . In a sense, it is more from the family of grand UN visions than a specific action plan.
Certainly, there are 17 goals. But the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) has 30 articles, none of which carry an action plan or indicators to monitor progress. Smart targets did not yet exist. But it sets out a vision, justifying and supporting progressive attitudes everywhere. It has since been translated into more than 300 languages , a world record. Insofar as documents signed many miles away can be useful to ordinary people struggling to fulfil their rights and potential, it does its job.
So I am broadly an SDG fan, because I hope it will do something similar. Having said that, there is no doubt that it is actions that matter, not just words. We need to set the SDG negotiators, and the governments they work for, a triple A challenge: the SDG agenda needs to be ambitious, actionable and accountable.
Ambition will not be a problem. It is the other two As we need to work on.
Related: EU must pull its weight to help create a better global financial system
In a new paper bringing together lessons from conversations held between a number of governments about how to implement the SDGs, David Steven, senior fellow at NYUs Center on International Cooperation , emphasises two things: the need to integrate the most important aspects of the agenda into national plans, and the need to improve data.
Translating the SDG agenda as agreed on the international stage into a workable action plan at the national level will be the big challenge. Steven says we must lose no time in getting started, arguing that any delay will be costly. I would add that momentum is critical  these are political targets and politics is all about the moment.
Steven makes clear that countries are not yet ready to deliver, and that prioritisation, even within this explicitly holistic and universal agenda, is not a dirty word  as long as the toughest challenges are not shunned.
Of data, there is already a great deal written  here is my tuppence worth . But there is no doubt that the international community must help countries improve evidence and information as they seek to meet the SDGs.
So much for actioning the SDGs. What about accountability? Of course, this is intimately related with action. If civil society, along with more formal accountability bodies, does not hold government to account with both political pressure and solid evidence, then we cant expect much action.
The vision of a world in which human rights are respected is still an inspiration to read, almost 70 years since it was first put on paper.
The SDG agenda is also visionary and inspiring. As the long process of drawing up the next set of global goals reaches its final straight, its ambition is assured. It is time to turn our attention to action and accountability in the hope of giving the whole process a triple A rating.

A 728km trek on treacherous bush roads from Garissa to the Ethiopian border aims to promote peace in this long-neglected region

We set off on the morning of 13 June from the town of Garissa in eastern Kenya . At first, our group was hundreds-strong, and included officials from the county and national government, all of us walking together to restore dignity and promote peace in a long-neglected region.
After 11km, only seven walkers remained as people offered their excuses, wished us luck and headed back into a town made infamous when Somali insurgents from al-Shabaab killed 147 people, mainly young students, on a university campus in April.
As I write, those of us who continued the Walk of Hope have covered 500km, heading deep into Kenyas North Eastern province. Our destination: border point one in Mandera, a town near Kenyas borders with Ethiopia and Somalia. In all, we planned to cover a gruelling 728km.
In one place, an old man insisted on offering us tea. The borehole there broke in 1978. No one had bothered to repair it
In north-eastern Kenya, the land is flat with sparse vegetation cover. Temperatures soar to 40C during the day and the nights can be cold and windy. Most people living here are ethnic Somalis, as am I.
The idea was to walk every day to the nearest settlement, by whatever means, covering between 15km and 43km. We never planned to sleep in the bush  we feared the snakes and scorpions.
As it turned out, we saw many scorpions on the road and just three snakes. It can be a little disappointing if you build an expectation.
Our choice of food was informed by ease of preparation rather than anything else. None of us felt like competent cooks. We packed a pickup full of tinned tuna, juice, energy drinks, dates and mineral water.The settlements we walked through typically featured a mixture of permanent and semi-permanent houses, a small school, a clinic and a borehole, if the residents were lucky.
The unlucky ones had just a school and maybe a borehole producing saline water. Clinics are a luxury in these places. The economy revolves round livestock: the settlements boom in the rainy season and bust during the dry season.
In one village, an old man insisted on offering us tea. The borehole there had broken in 1978, and nobody had bothered to repair it. I was born that year.
One thing stood out in all the villages we passed through: each had a beautiful little mosque with solar lighting and a booming speaker for the call to prayer. Some settlements had two mosques, competing for attention.
I was exhausted all the time and felt like I was walking on thorns, always inches away from giving up
On average, we walked 30km every day with the aim of finishing the walk in 25 days. Thats a brisk pace, which results in blisters and muscle pains. At 38, I was the oldest walker, an unfit lecturer: I was not a star performer. I was exhausted all the time and felt like I was walking on thorns, always inches away from giving up. My blisters became well known when I posted a picture on Facebook of my swollen feet, and the BBCs Somali service picked up the story. My blisters are overshadowing my real self, I mused. Red Cross paramedics followed us, ready to deal with our injuries, and sometimes offering massages.
In one settlement, people were bemused by these strange walkers. They had not yet heard about the Walk of Hope. So they grilled us to make sure we were not thugs or hoodlums. Then, they gave us mats and a temporary shed to sleep in. We were welcomed in many settlements with the traditional honour of slaughtering a goat.
The most challenging part of the walk was fasting. Fasting is obligatory for us Muslims during Ramadan, and since the walk is not a necessity we could not excuse ourselves on account of being travellers. We walked at night and rested during the day. This had its challenges: at night, we could not see what was in the bush.
We were not scared of wild animals  the lion is the only dangerous animal in these parts and all we saw were footprints. One night, we happened on a feisty hyena feeding on the carcass of a goat, but we were too tired to be bothered.
Whenever we reached a settlement, we visited the school and the health centre to check on provision there. Non-Somali teachers have refused to work in north-eastern Kenya after several attacks by al-Shabaab on non-Muslim citizens. Health workers were also scared away. We wanted to document the effects of these shortages.
We discovered that schools were terribly understaffed even before the attacks began.
The biggest problem in the many health centres we visited was the complete absence of doctors
In many places, the local community operates the government schools as if they were private institutions: they employ untrained teachers and students pay fees. No standards are enforceable, and the central examination system is a farce since students are not subjected to the same curriculum, teaching materials or teaching hours.
The biggest problem in the many health centres we visited was the complete absence of doctors. The best one can hope for is a nursing officer or a medical officer with a diploma from a medical training college. In Kenya, it seems, doctors are the preserve of city dwellers.
Security was always on our minds. Northern Kenya is often depicted as a wild land where bandits roam. Walking on the road made us vulnerable. We took all threats seriously  we could not be complacent.
One night we were camping in the bush when one of the guys saw a post on Facebook claiming that al-Shabaab wanted to attack the Walk of Hope. We were in the bush, 30km from the nearest settlement. We convinced ourselves that the fellow posting the threat was just seeking likes and decided to ignore it. I hardly slept that night, but not because I was scared  a very cold wind was blowing and I thought we would freeze to death, before anyone had a chance to attack us.
Similar posts appeared on the same page the next day. One night while trekking on a dirt road, a vehicle stopped a short distance away and three people jumped out and ran into the bush. We thought, This is it! but the attack never came. Nonetheless, we ran for our lives, straining our muscles and blistering our feet. It was the worst night of the walk.
And suddenly, that was the end of my journey: the rest could continue but my feet could no longer take the strain. Egg-sized blisters appeared between my toes, and my feet swelled up. I needed to see a doctor.
The Walk of Hope continues.
Salah Abdi Sheikh is an activist, author and former dean of the school of business and technology at Umma University. The other walkers are now at El Wak, about 175km from Mandera, which they hope to reach in six to eight days. Sheikh hopes to join them for the final 20km

Next week, the UN financing conference in Addis Ababa will take decisions that will have a profound impact on the global community over the next 15 years and beyond. Tax collection in developing countries will determine whether the sustainable development goals can rival the success of the millennium development goals , which expire this year.
For most developing countries, tax revenue lies somewhere between 10% and 15% of gross domestic product. Thats low compared with an average of about 35% for developed countries. In historical terms, however, its not that low. Throughout the 19th century, in all western countries tax revenue was below 10%. In his book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century , Thomas Piketty shows us that it was only after 1910 that tax revenue slowly started rising.
Low tax revenues meant that governments were able to fund only the most basic services, such as policing, the courts and the armed forces. Universal access to healthcare or education, infrastructure and a social safety net  in short, the foundations for decent, prosperous lives  call for much higher tax revenues.

This goal can be achieved, perhaps sooner than many of us ever dared dream. Success in the fight against hunger and poverty, under the banner of the MDGs, has changed our perception of what is possible. Now, the worlds bold new ambition is to leave no one behind.
To achieve this, we will have to, at last, realise the full potential of developing countries. This is known as domestic resource mobilisation, and it all starts with higher rates of tax revenue collection.
In order to be able to finance their share of the SDGs, developing countries will have to increase tax revenue collection to about 20% of GDP, according to the UN . I see three main areas for action.
First, ensure fair taxation. The urgency here is overwhelming. The UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) estimates that multinationals avoid $100bn worth of corporation tax in developing countries. Governments and international institutions now have to make good on promises to fight tax avoidance and tax evasion.
Second, strengthen tax inspectors. Developing countries need support to broaden their tax base and build tax collection capacity. Two years ago, the Netherlands started giving technical assistance to developing countries, and we now plan to double our current contribution. Today, we are active in 10 countries and we are starting an initiative to generate extra resources for building tax collection capacity.
I believe this is a good investment, because internationally the rate of return on such support is way over a factor of 10. We plan to launch this initiative at the Addis summit.
Countries that want to use these extra resources will need to express the political will to reform their tax systems. In developing countries, tax systems often have a regressive effect because they tend to rely heavily on consumption taxes, like VAT and excise duty, or on import levies. The poor end up paying a relatively high amount of tax because they spend all their income on goods subject to VAT, such as groceries and phone credit. And they pay import levies on their mobiles. There is no tax-free shopping for the poor.
Third, broaden the tax base. Developing countries need more capacity to administer and collect more complex forms of tax, like income and wealth taxes. Apart from VAT, countries need a progressive income tax regime. Because the poor are often hit harder by income tax too.
In Zambia, for instance, the sugar picker and the woman with a market stall pay more tax than the sugar factory itself. Businesses can use smart tax arrangements  tax avoidance tactics, in other words  to ensure they pay less than 1% in tax. While the market seller has to pay four times that rate on the couple of dollars she earns. That is not only wrong from a gender perspective; its completely unfair.
Thats why I am delighted that we have already agreed with five countries to revise our tax treaties. We have signed a new treaty with Malawi, and signed an amendment with Ethiopia, and we are holding discussions with seven other countries on updating treaties.
In total, we are looking to revise our treaties with 23 countries. Anti-abuse provisions  defining which companies get access to the treaty benefits  will ensure that the Netherlands is no longer an attractive option for companies that use tax avoidance tactics. Theirs is the kind of business we would rather do without.
These anti-abuse provisions are meant to exclude companies that only establish themselves in a third state to benefit from tax treaty advantages through that country, without having any other activities in that third state.
Finally, we regularly urge developing countries to be more discerning when awarding tax exemptions. The Netherlands is now putting its money where its mouth is. Along with other countries, we are prepared to forgo tax exemptions on goods and services that fall under official development assistance.
The task before us is daunting. The leap from the billions we needed for the MDGs to the trillions we will need to make the SDGs a success is a big one. But just consider what weve achieved already.
Ending hunger is within the grasp of this generation  a feat that seemed inconceivable only a generation ago. We must redouble our efforts if we want to do the same with poverty. It is possible to make the billions we provide in official development assistance spark the trillions that we need in private sector resources.
Above all, I see ways for developing countries to increase their tax revenues. That will enable them to unleash their full potential at last.

Sustainable development goals will be hard sell for United Nations

The goals were intended to serve as a precise, memorable and measurable way to focus development policy in the first years of the 21st century and to improve the lives of hundreds of millions of the worlds poorest people.
Underlying them, however, was a simple if stunning ambition; an epochal call to arms.
We will spare no effort to free our fellow men, women and children from the abject and dehumanising conditions of extreme poverty, to which more than a billion of them are currently subjected, ran the Millennium Declaration that was adopted at the summit.
We are committed to making the right to development a reality for everyone and to freeing the entire human race from want.
Related: UN: 15-year push ends extreme poverty for a billion people
If progress on the MDGs has been mixed  and the final report plainly admits that it has  then their architects can at least claim that progress on ending extreme poverty has been spectacular: between 1990 and this year, the number of those living in extreme poverty has fallen from 1.9 billion to 836 million.
Improvements in many other areas have been less impressive, however. Last year, the the UN deputy secretary general, Jan Eliasson, bemoaned the lack of action on clean water and sanitation , warning that the slow progress in building toilets and ending open defecation was having a staggering effect on the health, safety, education, prosperity and dignity of 2.5 billion people.
His comments came two months after Unesco admitted that there was no chance whatsoever that the millennium development goal of achieving universal primary education by 2015 would be met.
The MDGs have often been criticised for their naivety, their narrow interpretation of the ethos behind the millennium declaration and for their lack of focus on longterm, sustainable development. But they are at least acknowledged to have concentrated global attention on their separate eight areas.
Many fear that the MDGs replacements  the sustainable development goals , which will be agreed by the UN in September  will struggle to do even that.
Whereas the MDGs consisted of eight goals supported by 21 specific targets and 60 indicators, there are currently 17 SDGs comprising 169 targets. The number of indicators has yet to be set but there are likely to be hundreds .
The sheer number of goals, targets and indicators has prompted some to worry that the SDGs will be a hard sell.
The British prime minister, David Cameron, has made it clear that he favours fewer.
I dont believe they will cut it at 17, he said last year . There are too many to communicate effectively. Theres a real danger they will end up sitting on a bookshelf, gathering dust.
Despite this, the numbers look unlikely to change as reaching agreement even on 17 has been a long, hard slog.
But the UN is acutely aware of the need to grab peoples attention with the SDGs, which will set the development agenda until 2030. During last years SDG negotiations, the secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, grouped the goals into six essential elements: dignity, people, planet, prosperity, justice and partnership.
If the numerous SDGs are to make an impression on the global consciousness, they will need careful packaging and a simple, unifying message.
As Helen Clark, the head of the UN Development Programme , put it in January : We need to catch peoples imagination with this because if you just say sustainable development, eyes glaze. If you say, 17 goals, it takes a genius to recite the 17.

Bullets banish books in South Sudan as education becomes a casualty of war
Slim progress on education is set back as soldiers requisition school buildings and fighting forces children to flee, but some are returning to the classroom

At the end of a school day in the South Sudanese capital, Juba, young girls in light brown uniforms walk home, chatting in the late-afternoon sun. The scene should be repeated all over the country but over the past year and a half the civil war has forced hundreds of thousands of children out of school nationwide.
Education is one of the hidden casualties of South Sudans latest conflict, which began in December 2013 and shows little sign of ending. School buildings have been requisitioned by soldiers, pupils and their teachers have been press-ganged into armed groups, and an estimated 400,000 children have been forced out of school.
In the three worst affected states, Jonglei, Upper Nile and Unity, 70% of the 1,200 schools have been closed. In some counties, not a single school is open.

The education sector was a concern even before the war broke out: the national literacy rate of 27% was one of the lowest in the world, and primary school enrolment (47%) and completion (10%) rates were also unimpressive, though better than they had been during the long years of conflict before South Sudan seceded from Sudan.
At independence four years ago this week, South Sudan was one of the least developed countries in the world, and the new schools created in peace time were often extremely basic. Nevertheless, some progress was made. The countrys subsequent rapid descent into civil war reversed many of those slight gains.
Aliza Ruai knows what that feels like. She had been a student in Lich primary school, in Unity state, when the war began. In June 2014, she was forced to flee as the violence surged towards her home.
We could only move at night, says the 17-year-old. I couldnt see the fighting but I heard the guns. I was feeling very bad. I was afraid. My father was taken in April before we fled. I have not seen him since.
She missed her exams because of the fighting, and spent more time out of school as she looked after younger siblings. Now, though, she is studying again, at a makeshift school in the UN camp where she lives on the outskirts of Bentiu, the state capital.
Because I want a good life, I will study, she says. Maybe I can be a doctor or a teacher.
Samuel Liom is at the same school. He was 14 before he first went to school, since there wasnt one in his village. At first, he found it difficult to be in a class with much younger children, but he enjoyed learning so much that he overcame his embarrassment.
My favourite subject is social science because you learn how other countries are doing on justice and social issues
Samuel Liom
Like Aliza, Samuel was forced to flee the fighting in Unity state  what he calls the shooting and lootings  and dead bodies by the side of the road. At first, he wasnt sure whether it was worth going to school in the camp, but sitting around doing nothing became frustrating. Now he is back at school, and hopes to get a job with the UN. The civil war has sharpened the focus of his studies.
My favourite subject is social science because you will learn the world story  how other countries are doing in terms of justice and social issues, he says. If you do social studies, you know the heart of the country.
South Sudan needs peace, Samuel says, to allow him and others to lead normal lives.
Both Aliza and Samuel are studying at a school supported by Unicef as part of its Back to Learning Campaign , which has reached 121,000 children and hopes to help three times as many. Funding, though, is in short supply.

When a war breaks out, education sinks down the list of priorities. In 2014, around 1% of humanitarian spending went on education.
As the world meets in Oslo this week for a Summit on Education for Development , Unicef will argue for a higher priority for education in humanitarian emergencies.
We have to keep in mind that conflicts today, like in South Sudan, are lasting much longer, so we have to rethink the way traditional humanitarian assistance is provided, says Phuong T Nguyen from Unicef, in South Sudan.
Aspects of education are life-saving: how to protect yourself from cholera, the use of clean water, how to protect yourself from gender-based violence. Its not in the same sense as food but it is life-saving.
Many in South Sudan would agree. Edmund Yakani is a prominent activist who organises programmes to help provide schooling for children affected by conflict. Hes concerned that an entire generation is growing up without a proper education  making South Sudans future prospects even bleaker.
Even areas not directly affected by conflict are overwhelmed, he says. Class sizes have grown from around 45 to well over 100 in many cases, reducing the quality of education. And many teachers are getting work as humanitarians because the money is better. The educational cost of this war is high.

        <title>UN: 15-year push ends extreme poverty for a billion people</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/06/united-nations-extreme-poverty-millennium-development-goals</Link>

The millennium development goals (MDGs) have driven the most successful anti-poverty movement in history and brought more than a billion people out of extreme penury , but their achievements have been mixed and the world remains deeply riven by inequality, the UN s final report on the goals has concluded.
Ban Ki-moon , the UN secretary general, said that while the 15-year push to meet the eight goals  on poverty , education , gender equality , child mortality , maternal health , disease , the environment and global partnership  had yielded some astonishing results, it had left too many people behind.
MDG 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
The MDGs helped to lift more than one billion people out of extreme poverty, to make inroads against hunger, to enable more girls to attend school than ever before and to protect our planet, he said.
Yet for all the remarkable gains, I am keenly aware that inequalities persist and that progress has been uneven.
While the world has reduced the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day from 1.9 billion in 1990 to 836 million in 2015, the target of halving the proportion of people suffering from hunger was narrowly missed.
Between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of undernourished people fell from 23.3% to 12.9%. Current estimates suggest around 795 million people are undernourished  the overwhelming majority of them in developing regions. Progress has been hindered by higher food and energy prices, extreme weather, natural disasters, political instability, humanitarian crises and the economic recession of the late 1990s and in 2008-2009.
Ban noted that in 2011, nearly 60% of the worlds extremely poor people lived in five countries  India, Nigeria, China, Bangladesh and the Democratic Republic of Congo  and that familiar divisions and inequities were as stark as ever.
Too many women continue to die during pregnancy or from childbirth-related complications, he said. Progress tends to bypass women and those who are lowest on the economic ladder or are disadvantaged because of their age, disability or ethnicity. Disparities between rural and urban areas remain pronounced.
MDG 2: Achieve universal primary education
Progress on education has been mixed: the goal of achieving universal primary education has also just been missed, with the net enrolment rate rising from 83% in 2000 to 91% this year. The literacy rate for those aged 15 to 24 showed an identical rise, while the number of out-of-school children fell from 100 million 15 years ago to 57 million today.
Despite having to contend with a rising population, high levels of poverty and armed conflicts, sub-Saharan Africa made the greatest progress in primary school enrolment of all the developing regions, with its rate growing from 52% in 1990 to 78% in 2012.
Related: Sustainable development goals will be hard sell for United Nations
The push for gender equality and to empower women has led to about two-thirds of developing countries achieving gender parity in primary education  underlining the fact that the aspiration of eliminating gender disparity in primary and secondary education has not been met.
When it comes to employment outside the agricultural sector, women now constitute 41% of paid workers, up from 35% in 1990. Although the proportion of women in parliament has nearly doubled over the past 20 years, only one in every five seats is held by a woman. Efforts to narrow the gender divide continue to be stymied by discrimination in law and practice, violence against women and girls, unequal employment opportunities and unequal division of unpaid care and domestic work.
While the child mortality rate has declined by more than half over the past 25 years  falling from 90 to 43 deaths per 1,000 live births  it has not declined by the MDG aim of two-thirds. Vaccination helped to prevent nearly 15.6m deaths from measles between 2000 and 2013, but that progress has slowed since 2010, with an estimated 21.6 million infants not receiving the vaccine in 2013. The biggest preventable causes of death for children under five are pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria, which between them claim 16,000 lives a day.
MDG 4: Reduce child mortality
The aspiration of reducing the maternal mortality ratio by three-quarters has not been realised, with the ratio falling by nearly half (from 380 deaths per 100,000 live births to 210). Today, only half of pregnant women in developing regions receive the recommended minimum of four antenatal visits, and a quarter of babies worldwide are delivered without skilled care. Postpartum haemorrhage accounted for 27% of maternal deaths in developing regions between 2003 and 2009; other major complications were high blood pressure during pregnancy, complications from delivery and unsafe abortion.
Progress on combating HIV/Aids, malaria and other diseases has also varied. The target of halting and beginning to reverse the spread of HIV/Aids by 2015 has not been met, although the number of new HIV infections fell by around 40% between 2000 and 2013, from 3.5 million cases to 2.1 million. The fight is being hindered by risky sexual behaviour and a lack of basic knowledge about HIV among young people in many countries.
The target of halting and reversing the incidence of malaria has been achieved thanks to a tenfold increase in international financing since 2000 and sustained malaria prevention and treatment initiatives. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets, indoor spraying, diagnostic testing and the use of effective drugs have helped prevent more than 6.2m deaths from the disease between 2000 and 2015. The global malaria incidence rate has fallen by more than a third and the mortality rate by more than half. Significant progress has been made in the fight against tuberculosis: improved prevention, diagnosis and treatment saved an estimated 37m lives between 2000 and 2013.
The push for environmental sustainability has brought some 2.6 billion people access to improved drinking water since 1990, meaning that the target of halving the proportion of people without access to improved sources of water was achieved in 2010  five years ahead of schedule. However, 663 million are still without improved drinking water.
MDG 7: Ensure environmental sustainability
Efforts on sanitation have fared far less well: 2.1 billion people have gained access to improved sanitation (a toilet that hygienically separates faeces from human contact) since 1990, leaving the target of halving the number of people without access to basic sanitation short by nearly 700 million people.
Some 2.4 billion people in developing countries  a third of humanity  still lack access to improved sanitation facilities, while 946 million people still practise open defecation.
The differences between rural and urban areas are often considerable. While four out of five people in urban areas have access to piped drinking water, the figure for those in rural areas is just one in three. Nearly half of those in rural areas lack access to improved sanitation facilities compared with less than a fifth of those in urban areas.
Moves to improve the way the world works together on development have been aided by an increase in the amount of official development assistance (ODA) that rich countries give to developing nations. Between 2000 and 2014, ODA increased by 66% in real terms and hit a record high of $134.8bn (80.3bn) in 2013 .
Ban said that lessons had to be learned from the MDGs as the world prepares to agree their successors, the sustainable development goals , which will set the agenda for the next 15 years.
We need to tackle root causes and do more to integrate the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, he said.
Reflecting on the MDGs and looking ahead to the next 15 years, there is no question that we can deliver on our shared responsibility to end poverty, leave no one behind and create a world of dignity for all.

The new Ebola outbreak in Liberia last week was not unexpected, and more like it may occur, according to the UN special envoy on Ebola, Dr David Nabarro.
The 17-year-old whose death signalled the outbreak in Liberia may have come into contact with an infected animal or picked up the virus from a person in whom it had lingered beyond the 21-day quarantine period, experts believe.
Related: Two new Ebola cases in Liberia, seven weeks after country declared virus-free
Two more people from the teenagers village have fallen ill since the boys death last Sunday, but although the new cases have dismayed the government, population and health experts, Nabarro said that because of the large amount of virus that has been in circulation, this could be the pattern for some time to come.
Were still pretty confident it is going to end, in a period which is not unreasonable, but I dont think the end will necessarily be the end. There will be subsequent mini flare-ups occurring all over the place, he said.
How the teenager became infected is the subject of rumour and speculation, because he is not thought to have come into contact with anybody from Sierra Leone or Guinea, where there are still cases.
But, said Nabarro, there has been an awful lot of virus around. Some of it may have gone back into the animal kingdom. That could mean the virus occurring in animals in locations where there was none in the past, increasing the chances of disease if people eat or are in physical contact with infected animals, such as fruit bats.
This epidemic has also shown that the virus can linger beyond the 21-day quarantine period in the prostate in men and in the eyes in both men and women, he said. It has been found in amniotic fluid and in the foetuses of women who were pregnant when they became infected with Ebola but survived.
We dont know yet whether they are an undetected chain of transmission, because Margibi [the county where the cases occurred] was one of the last parts of Liberia to be declared Ebola-free, or whether they are the result of some kind of perpetuation of the virus, survivors that we hadnt known about, or whether they represent a brand-new arrival of the virus from outside the human race  a new Ebola appearance  and that answer will not be known for some time, Nabarro said.
Examination of past Ebola outbreaks since the disease was first identified four decades ago shows a 50% probability of isolated mini outbreaks within a year after the main one has been declared over, he said. While there is not absolute clarity on this, it appeared that the reasons were perpetuation of the virus in survivors or re-introduction from animals which may have picked it up from infected humans.
Nabarro praised the calm and confident Liberian response to the new cases, as well as the handling of the continuing epidemic in the other affected countries. The communities in Sierra Leone and Guinea where there are still cases now need to be approached with great sensitivity, said Nabarro.
These are communities that want to be left alone, with their cultural values and traditions undisturbed, he said. It was important to focus on individual households in a quiet and non-aggressive way and listen to them. People are very, very scared, he said. They are scared they are going to get into trouble with the authorities but they are scared that they will get into trouble with the spiritual world if they dont do their burials right. It needs a very sensitive response.
Nabarro was speaking before a major UN conference aimed at encouraging donations to help the three hard-hit west African countries recover from the damage of the epidemic.
At the secretary generals international conference on early recovery, which begins on Friday in New York, donors are expected to offer help with restoring health and education systems, but it is thought likely the governments of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea will hope for more assistance to rebuild their economies.

        <title>Make poverty history? A decade on from Gleneagles, it is a genuine possibility | Adrian Lovett</title>

It is hard to believe that, when world leaders met at Gleneagles 10 years ago on Monday , nobody on the planet had an iPhone, YouTube was preparing to open its first office above a Silicon Valley pizza house, and tweeting was confined to birds. But looking back on that day, when the Make Poverty History campaign reached its climax at the G8 summit, it is clear the world has changed in many more ways.
On 6 July 2005 I was in Edinburgh, preparing to head to Gleneagles to make our case. Days earlier, we had mobilised half a million people at the huge Edinburgh Make Poverty History rally  the largest in Scottish history  and at the Live 8 concerts in London and around the world. Seven million white campaign wristbands had been worn in the UK, and tens of millions more worldwide, challenging leaders to act. The G8s answer included a promise of $48bn (31bn) in new aid  half of it to Africa  and outright debt cancellation for many of the worlds poorest countries.
It wasnt everything the campaign had asked for, and it hasnt all been plain sailing since. Shamefully, some of the richest countries have reneged on the promises they made that day. But the deal done at Gleneagles, unlike the faded Nokia 3310 I clutched back then, has looked better with the passing of time. Those who kept their word, along with strong political leadership from within Africa itself, have helped transform the world since.

The change becomes real when seen up close. A while ago I visited a government health clinic supported by Save the Children in South Wollo, Ethiopia, eight hours drive from the capital. With increased aid and its own resources, the Ethiopian government has been able to extend the treatment of deadly childhood illnesses like diarrhoea and pneumonia, with a new army of equipped and empowered community health workers.
I was shown a meticulously maintained record book listing each patient that came in  mainly children  with names, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. The final column on the ledger was headed outcome; in each row, the entry almost invariably contained a single word: better. The same was true in one clinic after another. Seeing that combination of real, micro-level data with demonstrable success and progress was exhilarating. I wished that every white-band wearer in the world could have stood there too and read that roll call of hope.
Perhaps the most profound change is in the perceived achievability of Make Poverty Historys mission. In 2005, despite Nelson Mandelas insistence that extreme poverty could be overcome just like slavery and apartheid, many observers  and even some campaigners  assumed it was an unreachable pipedream.

Ten years on, that aim of ensuring that nobody should live in absolute poverty by 2030 is set to be enshrined in the sustainable development goals , which will be signed by world leaders at the UN this September. The campaign slogan has become the first item on the worlds to-do list. And the reason for that new sense of possibility? Were halfway there.
The extreme poverty figure has dropped from 43% of the worlds people in 1990 to 21% in 2010 . And its continuing to fall. The virtual elimination of extreme poverty in the next 15 years wont be easy  in fact, it will be an increasingly hard slog. But nobody now says it cannot be done. The question is whether we will choose to do it.
Policymakers need to start to answer that question this month when they gather for the financing for development summit due to be held, neatly, in Addis Ababa  capital city of the country that became a byword for famine 30 years ago and is now at the frontline of the data-driven fight to end hunger and extreme poverty for good.
If the map of poverty and development has transformed in 10 years, the way we run campaigns has changed almost as much  and thats a change for the better, too. Networks like Avaaz and change.org , unheard of in 2005, have harnessed internet and social media platforms to put power in peoples hands and turn leadership pyramids upside down.
A growing movement of global citizens is forming. And that movement is more authentic and representative than ever, no longer directed from Washington, New York or London. One s membership of nearly 7 million people includes 2 million from Africa. After watching 250 One youth ambassadors from across Europe and beyond, who came (with some very big balloons) to southern Germany for last months G7 summit , I know we are in great shape for the fight ahead. These are smart, savvy, passionate advocates who know their facts. They also know that facts are nothing without activism  and activism means little unless we take it to where decisions are made, get them changed, and hold decision-makers accountable.
Not so different from Make Poverty History perhaps, at its best. But  I hope  more global, more sustainable and more empowering. Oh, and now we can tweet about it too.

In global healthcare, quality and access are what matters  not who delivers it
In fragile states, private sector healthcare is vital in plugging the gaps in public services. We need to engage with it  like it or not, it may be the only option

When the UN financing for development conference begins in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, theres likely to be a big elephant in the room: the private sector.
Some commentators have warned of the possible implications of pursuing ultra-free market ideologies that see private companies as key providers of basic public services. Ignoring the private sector rather than working with it would seem like the most morally defensible approach when faced with the prospect of large corporations selling health and education services with the sole objective of turning a profit.
Related: Health sustainable development goal must tackle inequity head on to succeed
Sometimes, though  whether we like it or not  the private sector might be our only option. Take fragile and conflict-affected states: the World Bank estimates that more than 1.2 billion people live in countries affected by widespread conflict and political unrest. The UK Department for International Development and other donors have flagged these countries as a priority category.
Given their vulnerability, fragile and conflict-affected states simply do not have access to the large amounts of state expenditure needed to provide widespread coverage of basic services. World Health Organisation data from 2013 shows that in Afghanistan, government expenditure on health amounted to just 21% of total health expenditure (compared with 84% in the UK).
Donors are also unlikely to commit to long-term aid funding where they cant easily link this expenditure to immediate, tangible outcomes  an unrealistic expectation in fragile states where, by definition, the focus needs to be on long-term systemic change.
In these contexts, it is hardly surprising that privately run services step in to plug the gap. In Somalia, despite the population having one of the lowest rates of GDP per capita in the world , the private sector delivers more than 60% of the countrys healthcare services . In these situations, where the private sector is already a fixture, the question is not how to prevent companies from filling the gap left by ineffective state structures, but rather how to work with these companies to ensure the gap-filling is good enough to promote positive, lasting impact.

There are some fundamental areas that need addressing.
First, a lack of regulatory frameworks and inspection procedures can result in huge negative social and economic consequences. Our work , investigating private healthcare provision in Somalia, highlighted some disturbing results: the proliferation and sale of unregulated and potentially dangerous pharmaceutical products not only puts patients at risk but is also likely to lead to a greater burden on public health services when remedial treatments are needed further down the line.
Poor market oversight can also make life difficult for businesses trying to tailor their products and services to appropriate customer bases. In Somalia, the unfettered boom in hospitals and smaller clinics has made it difficult for enterprises to differentiate themselves, resulting in negative competition that benefits neither the business nor the customer.
The public sector has a key role to play in addressing these issues, helping to ensure the introduction and enforcement of minimum standards and accreditations. This will necessitate meaningful collaboration between the sectors  working with, rather than against, private enterprises. In some cases, NGOs are stepping in to fill the void. In Somaliland, PSI s network of recognisable BulshoKaab Pharmacies is a good example of a successful attempt to give credibility to quality services in an ever-expanding marketplace.
In Somaliland and Puntland, we are seeing the emergence of informal referral systems whereby the private sector sends emergency cases to the public sector, and public sector facilities pass on cases requiring specialist skills and equipment to their private sector counterparts. We found a general desire among health workers to formalise these relationships to help improve basic efficiencies  for example, by establishing systems allowing data on the availability of beds to be shared.
In critically vulnerable environments, it is clearly important that we work with what is already in place to support the delivery of basic services. Private sector facilities spring up to plug the gap left behind by weak public institutions and a lack of capacity and funding. Their continued existence is testament to the demand for them. While this might not be to everyones ideological taste, it is sometimes the reality on the ground. In fragile and conflict-affected states, it is often the only reality.
The public sector has an important role to play in promoting the regulation and oversight of these services, ensuring they are really working for the customers they aim  and claim  to serve. Sustainable development goal 17 talks of engaging with the private sector to help strengthen the global partnership for sustainable development.
It is time to catch up with private service providers to ensure this engagement is truly sustainable. What should matter is quality and access. Not who delivers it.

Murder, drug cartels and misery counter Argentina's claims of falling poverty
President Cristina Fernndez de Kirchners suggestion that Argentinas poverty rate has been cut to less than 5% rings false with experts and locals alike

The gangland murder of four youths in a notorious slum in the south of Buenos Aires came as little surprise to residents. The victims of last Aprils attack had each been shot in the head by hitmen amid an ongoing turf war between rival gangs.
Known as  villas miserias   literally, slums of misery  the sprawls of redbrick shacks that punctuate the Parisian-style architecture of the Argentinian capital have become synonymous with violence.
These marginal neighbourhoods have little or no state presence to oppose the growing influence of drug cartels. Despite often being located in urban centres, most residents do not have access to mains electricity, running water or sewers.
In 2013, the NGO Techo identified 1,834 of these informal settlements across Argentina, saying they were home to 500,000 families. In Buenos Aires alone, the number of people living in villas miserias grew by about 50% between 2001 and 2010.
These fringe communities have become the focal point of the fight against poverty in the South American country, with investment from the government and NGOs focused on providing basic services and integrating them into wider society.
After Argentinas devastating debt default in 2001/2, a boom in social security spending did much to sustain high growth rates. But the success of these social programmes has been threatened by another default and an inflation-inducing currency devaluation last year.
This bleak picture seems to sound a false note given the governments claims that Argentina has one of the lowest poverty rates in the world.
At a UN Food and Agriculture Organisation summit in Rome in June, President Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner said the poverty rate was now lower than 5%, compared with a crippling 54% in 2003.
When Anbal Fernndez, head of the Argentine cabinet, was later asked on national radio if the country had truly achieved a poverty rate lower than, say, Norway, Denmark and Germany, he replied: Yes, although you might not like it and it is difficult for you to accept. Countries like Germany are having a difficult time with poverty.
Even discounting the fact that poverty rates in Germany and other European countries are based on different calculations, the validity of figures published by Argentinas Indec statistics agency has long been challenged.
In terms of fiddling the figures, the [Fernndez presidency] has considerable form  from cooking the books on inflation, to massaging growth data and  fudging poverty data, said Colin M Lewis, professor emeritus and Argentina expert at the London School of Economics .
A regime that presents itself as a champion of the poor has even more reason than most for making exaggerated claims about poverty reduction, particularly as inflation accelerates and a decline in the rate of inequality appears to be stalling, he added.

It is widely acknowledged that Indec has long published an artificially low consumer price index (CPI). Private economists estimate inflation at more than 25% , while the government has said it is about 15%.
But despite evidence of creative accounting, there has also been real progress in tackling poverty, some analysts say.
The reason why the president has high approval ratings of around 50% is that many people have seen their living standards rise  unemployment is low and average wages have risen faster than prices during her tenure, even when you use the estimates of inflation favoured by the opposition, said Paul Segal, a senior economics lecturer at Kings College London .
Argentina measures its poverty rate by calculating the number of people who cannot afford a basic basket of goods and services, such as education and housing. This basket is directly linked to the CPI, which statisticians say can lead to abuse.
If inflation is high, the basket value increases, and therefore poverty increases. This is politically inexpedient for a president whose election, and continued popularity, is partially grounded in a promise to reduce poverty, said Christopher Wylde, associate professor of international relations at Richmond, the American International University in London .
Manipulating the official inflation rate serves a wider set of priorities, and its impact on poverty data could be interpreted as somewhat tangential. These wider priorities include: lower repayments on inflation-indexed bonds, better gross domestic product data  the impact on the real effective exchange rate and the concomitant impact on balance of payments through the trade channel, and a better bargaining position with unions, who use inflation data to negotiate pay increases, Wylde said.
An independent study by the Universidad Catlica Argentina , released in April last year and using more realistic CPI data, reported a poverty rate of roughly 26% in 2013.
Away from the rarefied air of pure statistics, in the low shacks of the villas miserias, people echo the charges of official exaggeration and manipulation, grounding their anger in daily deprivations.
In our neighbourhoods, entire families are homeless and theres no drinkable water. Where is this reduction in poverty? said Viviana, an NGO advocate who works in a slum in the gentrified barrio of Retiro in Buenos Aires. She did not want to give her last name for fear of harassment by the authorities.
Its a joke that the president would announce that [poverty rate] to the world. That number, so untenable to the Argentine eye, is something shed never say to the people who live in las villas miserias. Thats only something she could have said in Rome.
Indec has agreed to reform its methodology on measuring inflation and poverty but, given that no fresh data on poverty has been published since December 2013, it seems unlikely anything will change before legislative and presidential elections in October. Fernndez, whose Front for Victory party has held power since 2003, is barred from standing for a third consecutive term .
With persistent economic instability, fears about the prevalence of drug cartels and a creeping fiscal deficit , the ghosts of 2001 haunt every Argentine politician.

Yemen's humanitarian crisis leaves a million people in dire straits  in pictures
The UN has declared its highest-level humanitarian emergency in Yemen, where months of fighting and a blockade by a Saudi-led coalition have left about 80% of the population in need of aid. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, has called for a pause in hostilities until the end of Ramadan so that assistance can be delivered. But a senior UN official warns the country is one step from famine

On Wednesday, a Saudi Arabian billionaire, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, announced he would donate his $32bn (20bn) fortune to charity over the coming years . The decision, he said, had been motivated by his life-long commitment to helping to build a more peaceful, equitable and sustainable world for generations to come.
If the money were split equally among the eight programmes the prince suggested  with $4bn going to each  what might it achieve? Here are some of the options.
Modernisation and infrastructure
The full $32bn, meanwhile, could take energy supplies to more than half the places off the grid in Africa (source: Overseas Development Institute ).
Poverty alleviation
A $4bn windfall would go about 80% of the way to ensuring every person in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  one of the poorest countries on the planet  has access to basic services such as health and education (source: ONE campaign ).
The same sum would cover the funding gap for essential health and education services for everyone in Tanzania , Zambia and Liberia (source: ONE campaign).
Disaster relief
$4bn would cover the total bill to help the Syrian refugees who have fled to nearby countries , providing essentials like clean water, adequate shelter and food assistance (source: Oxfam ).
A $4bn injection would fully fund roughly 20% of the current worldwide humanitarian needs. Or, more specifically, it would just about cover the gap in funding for the entire Syrian regional refugee response and the funding gap on South Sudan combined (source: Care International).
The same sum would almost cover the funding gap for 12 other ongoing humanitarian crises around the world (source: Care International).
Education and empowering children
With support worth $4bn, the 58 million children left behind by the millennium development goal on education would be able to go to primary school (source: Care International ).
Just $500,000 could enable 1,000 schools in Pakistan to use the latest technology to plan, prepare and manage against the risk of attacks, enabling children to attend school more safely. The sum would cover the creation of school safety strategies using analytical software, and working with communities to implement them (source: Unicef ).
A $1,000,000 investment would enable 10,000 nomadic children in Eritrea to go to school. This could include establishing new nomadic learning centres, expanding existing ones, and training teachers to enable the most marginalised children to access their right to a quality education for the long term (source: Unicef).
$3.2bn would feed the 66 million school-aged children who go hungry . Being well-nourished would give poorer children a far greater chance of getting an education and bringing themselves out of poverty through better paid work (source: Oxfam ).
Promotion of health
For $4bn, more than 12 million people could be provided with antiretroviral drugs  more than the total number of people living with HIV/Aids across the least developed countries. Alternatively, the money would pay for 190 million children to be fully vaccinated, saving more than 6 million lives (source: One campaign).
Spending $4bn on water and sanitation services would also go a long way to relieving a health crisis that kills 1,400 children every day (source: WaterAid ).
A $4bn investment would also build 666m basic pit latrines, or 111m improved latrines  which include a ventilation pipe and mesh to reduce odours  to serve 555 million people (source: WaterAid).
With $4bn, it would also be possible to reach as many as 167 million of the 179 million people living in the 17 countries worst off for access to clean water. Assuming there were no other obstacles, that means every person who right now lives without water in Angola , Chad , DRC, Guinea , Eritrea, Ethiopia , Haiti , Madagascar , Mauritania , Mozambique , Niger , Tanzania and Papua New Guinea (source: WaterAid).
Empowering women
Given that the median income of womens rights organisations worldwide is $20,000 a year, $4bn would fund 10,000 womens rights organisations for 20 years (source: Mama Cash ).

The slow unfolding of the sustainable development goals continued last month with the unveiling of the zero draft that will be negotiated in the runup to the summit in New York in September.
How does the draft of 17 goals look from the perspective of an organisation dedicated to helping countries to strengthen democracy? The answer is not bad, but not good.
Related: Albania makes headway in the battle against corruption
On the plus side, it is good that there is a goal 16 at all. The draft goal reads: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.
There was no equivalent in the millennium development goals (MDGs), and it is welcome that goal 16 includes a target of ensuring responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels.
I like all those words, which embody a commendable set of ambitions. The target of effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels is a good transposition of text from the UN high-level panel report on the post-2015 development agenda co-chaired by the presidents of Liberia and Indonesia and the British prime minister, which included all three adjectives.
On the minus side, there are two main gaps.
First, the word democracy itself has not been used, nor any variant such as democratic accountability. That is disappointing but not surprising, even though the Millennium Declaration , which formed the basis of the MDGs, did make specific calls for these conditions to be included.
Perhaps the word democracy is less popular than 15 years ago and it was blocked by the sensitivities of UN politics
My guess is that the word democracy, perhaps less popular now than it was 15 years ago, was blocked by the sensitivities of UN politics.
The second gap is the failure to address the key instruments of representative democracy, namely parliaments or political parties. Again, this is disappointing but not surprising. There is a presumption in the text that the executive are the main actors, rather than the representatives of citizens. Indeed, the high-level panel called for someone (implicitly governments) to grant rights (such as freedom of speech) to people, rather than for people to act to curb the powers of the executive.
So what should be the response of those interested in strengthening democracy? We need to do two things.
First, we should demystify democracy. Democracy is not a western plot, it is a universal value. Virtually all countries have aspects of democratic culture in place to some degree, and absolutely every country has room to strengthen the quality of their democracy.
I would like to build common ground about the aspects of democracy that are important regardless of region or political grouping. That would make work on achieving the targets in goal 16 much more useful.
Related: Nigeria's free and fair elections are an inspiration for nascent democracies | Kofi Annan
Second, the Millennium Declaration is still relevant when it says that we should work collectively for more inclusive political processes, allowing genuine participation by all citizens in all our countries. We should rebalance our thinking about national responsibilities, taking up that challenge of putting people and their representatives first. This links back to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . The central task of the declaration, and of the Magna Carta for that matter, was to curb the power of the executive  which, unchecked, tends to be abused.
In the vast majority of countries, we should look at the role of parliaments, the judiciary, civil society and the media, as well as the executive, when considering how to secure objectives encapsulated in goal 16.
A report by Civicus called for new forms of representation and oversight, such as citizens panels. Institutions should be tested on their ability to respond to and achieve progress on issues identified by people rather than just governments, it added.
The sentiment certainly reflects the level of concern many people feel about traditional representative institutions. Building common ground on what democracy means, and helping to improve the quality of representation in our countries, go hand in hand and are both worth pursuing.
Goal 16 is imperfect and is almost at the bottom of the list of proposed SDGs. But the glass is half full. Politics and the development community have been uncomfortable partners in many ways, and this is a chance to work together to help political systems do a better job. If we succeed, then we will have fulfilled the promise of the Millennium Declaration  citizens of all countries working together to put sustainable development at the centre of the agenda and hold governments to account for their actions.

Sir Fazle Hasan Abed, the founder of Brac , the largest non-governmental organisation on the planet, has been awarded the 2015 World Food prize for his unparalleled work on reducing poverty in Bangladesh and 10 other countries.
Abed established Brac  formerly known as the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee  in 1972 as a relief operation to help the country recover from its war of independence with Pakistan and the destruction wrought by a tropical cyclone.
The organisations focus soon switched to finding new ways to tackle poverty and empower women socially and economically, and it is estimated to have brought nearly 150 million people out of poverty since its foundation.
Today, it has a staff of 110,000 and works in 11 countries: Bangladesh, Afghanistan , Pakistan , the Philippines , Sri Lanka , Liberia , Sierra Leone , South Sudan , Tanzania , Uganda and Haiti .
Dr MS Swaminathan, chair of the World Food prize selection committee and the first World Food prize laureate in 1987, described Abed as a strategic thinker, and a man with a future vision. He also praised the NGO for its constant innovation and bold use of funding.
It's a great satisfaction for us to to receive recognition of the work weve done for the last 43 years
Fazle Hasan Abed
While funding was important, Abed realised that the organisation needed some internal financial resources in order to steer its course, rather than become diverted by donor agendas, he said.
He therefore set up a considerable number of commercial enterprises as part of the Brac brand. These include printing presses, manufacturing industries, a hotel, conference facilities, retail outlets and the private Brac University, among others. Surpluses from these enterprises go into supporting Bracs development programmes.
Abed, who was knighted by the Queen in 2010, described the award as a tremendous honour, adding: Im sure this will be a great joy for our staff and energise them even more. Its a great satisfaction for us to receive recognition of the work weve done for the last 43 years.
He said he was particularly proud of Bracs work on tackling child mortality in Bangladesh in the 1980s, which saw the number of deaths halved over a decade.
Brac's work on tackling child mortality in Bangladesh in the 1980s saw the number of deaths halved over a decade
We went to every household in Bangladesh teaching mothers how to make oral rehydration fluid at home to combat diarrhoeal deaths, he said. That also made it possible for Brac to become a very large organisation very quickly and to expand our programmes throughout the country.
Equally productive, he said, had been Bracs push to raise the rates of child immunisation in the last few years of the same decade. Between 1986 and 1990, the proportion of immunised Bangladeshi children rose from 2% to 70% . In the areas where Brac works, he added, the immunisation rate is now at 95%.
Abed said that although Bracs approach is multifaceted, it was founded on a simple principle.
We have worked on many different aspects of poverty: mortality reduction; maternal mortality and health; family planning; financial services for women; womens empowerment; agriculture, and all kinds of livelihoods for poor people so that they could come out of extreme poverty and malnutrition, he said.
Everything we did in Bangladesh we did with one focus: getting poor people out of poverty because we feel that poverty is dehumanising.
With the world preparing to adopt the sustainable development goals  which will replace the millennium development goals and set the global development agenda for the next 15 years  Abed called for a renewed focus on eliminating extreme poverty.
He said that Bracs work with the poorest 8% of Bangladeshis had shown that even the ultra-poor could be reached if sufficient resources and commitment were available. Bracs two-year programme, designed to help those who are too poor for microfinance loans, involves using grants, monthly stipends and health services to support families while they learn about making money and household budgeting.
The programme has since been rolled out in several countries  Ghana, Ethiopia, India, Pakistan, Honduras and Peru where it has also proved successful.
Taking people out of extreme poverty can be done but you need the commitment to do it in every country throughout the world, said Abed.
Thats the problem  do we have the commitment in every country to take the extreme poor out of their misery? Do we have good governance in every country? There are many factors that affect development and hopefully these will also be part of the sustainable development goals: good governance and the eradication of corruption from societies.

Girls' education will only make the grade when intuition gives way to information
With education increasingly in the global spotlight, research must be undertaken to pinpoint the factors that cause girls to struggle or drop out

Schools have the potential to transform girls lives, unlocking the door to future opportunities, better health and greater autonomy. But in many places, schooling falls short of that aspiration.
In May, global educators gathered at the World Education Forum in Korea to agree on a post-2015 global education agenda. In June, the US first lady Michelle Obama visited the UK to help launch a UK/US partnership that will invest nearly $200m (128m) in supporting girls education in countries affected by conflict, starting with the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
Next week, global educators will gather again, this time in Norway at the Oslo summit on education for development . There, they will work to strengthen and renew political commitments on education and improving learning outcomes for children worldwide.
And in September, world leaders will gather at the UN general assembly in New York to adopt the sustainable development goals , which will replace the millennium development goals and shape the international development agenda until 2030.
Given this growing momentum, now is clearly the time to ensure global organisations are committed to using rigorous evidence to improve education.
Girls face more barriers to learning than boys, particularly around the time of puberty . Understanding the relationship between events in girls lives and their ability to succeed in school will be key to achieving not only the post-2015 education goals but arguably the other development goals as well.
Over the past 25 years, access to school has increased dramatically. The gender gap has narrowed. More girls than ever are in school, and they are staying in school longer. Even in the developing world, adolescent girls are more likely to be in school than out of school. We need to celebrate that success.
But as girls stay in education longer, the challenges they face outside school have the potential to disrupt their education. Factors including early pregnancy , sexually transmitted infections, child marriage and sexual and gender-based violence all pose challenges. Many girls are grappling with these issues today  and those in the education sector need to know how to respond.
For decades, the Population Council and others have been studying disparities in education  disparities between girls and boys, between the poorest and most vulnerable populations and those who are better off. We have looked at what works in girls education, and analysed what girls need to complete primary school, and to gain access to a high-quality, safe secondary school where they can complete their education. We have looked at how to ensure girls learn in school and go on to become healthy, productive adults.
One thing we have noticed is just how difficult it is to pinpoint what causes girls to struggle in school or to drop out during adolescence. So many life changes happen during this time. A lot can depend on where a girl lives, how she is doing in school, and what pressures her family is facing.
But while it is difficult to tease out the exact reasons girls leave school, its crucial that we do try, because the causes determine the solutions. Pregnancy and early marriage are not necessarily the only issues. We must look deeper at which girls are most likely to become pregnant, get married or leave school prematurely. For example, if a girls family is poor and unable or unwilling to pay school fees, she may not have the support she needs to continue her education. Her parents may decide marriage is a better option for her future security.
In 2009, we conducted a review of more than 300 adolescent girls education programmes from around the world. The study revealed that the majority of these programmes were not based on evidence and were not evaluated to demonstrate whether or not they were achieving their goals.
Of the 11 most common programme interventions for adolescent girls, only two having female teachers and providing financial help  had been proven to be effective.
Too often, the scarce resources invested in girls education are going to programmes that lack evidence-based proof of success. These programmes are not being rigorously evaluated to see if they help girls stay in school longer, retain skills, and live healthy, productive lives.
To reap the benefits for girls and societies, we need evidence, not just intuition, to guide our efforts. Donors and policymakers must commit to using evidence  about the problem and what works to address it  when developing policies and deciding on funding.
Donors and implementing organisations should hold themselves to high standards: let no programme be implemented or funded without a solid base of evidence behind it, or a significant commitment to evaluation within it.
As world leaders put the final touches to the post-2015 education goals, a commitment to rigorous evidence must be a top priority. We are heartened by the new US/UK investment in education, because the agreement includes a welcome commitment of 10m from the UK to build the evidence base around adolescent girls education. We encourage others to follow this example.

Less than one-quarter of Australias aid money is going to the worlds poorest nations, new analysis by aid organisation One has revealed.
About 22.7% of aid money goes to the least developed nations, with the Abbott government instead opting to focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Around 20% of the worlds poorest countries are in that region, with more than two-thirds in sub-Saharan Africa.
Australias aid budget has been slashed by $11bn over the last few years, and in the 2013-14 financial year, the country spent $4.7bn on development funding. Just 5% of that  $240m  went to sub-Saharan Africa. A further $713m went to other under-developed nations.
Nearly all jurisdictions received a cut to funding, as outlined in the 2014-15 May budget , but sub-Saharan Africa received one of the largest cuts, losing 70% of its funding.
Aid group One wants donor countries like Australia to adopt new goals for next weeks aid conference in Ethiopia.
The United Nations financing for development conference will plot out a financial pathway end extreme poverty by 2030, and is the last major aid meeting before the sustainable development goals are adopted in New York in September.
The new goals will replace the Millennium Development Goals, many of which fell by the wayside when the global financial crisis hit.
One said donor countries must commit to raising its aid funding to 0.7% of gross national income (GNI), of which 50% should go to the worlds least developed countries.
2015 could be a game changer for the worlds most vulnerable people, but decisions taken in Addis Ababa will determine whether the opportunity is seized or squandered, said Ones director of global policy, Eloise Todd. We wont see an end to extreme poverty unless countries like Australia shift focus to the poorest countries and the poorest people.
So far, the Abbott government has been historic for all the wrong reasons, overseeing cuts to the aid budget that have set Australia down the path to being the least generous its ever been in terms of aid , she said.
Australia currently spends 0.27% of GNI in aid. By contrast, Britain is one of the few countries to have met the 0.7% aid goal.
The US provides the most aid in terms of quantity, nudging $33bn in 2013-14. But by proportion the figure is low, representing 0.19% of GNI.
Both the US and Britain have increased their aid contribution to sub-Saharan Africa by more than 7% in one year.
One also wants donor countries to focus on aid programs that offer basic services like health and education, particularly for women, and urges recipient nations to strengthen anti-corruption measures so that aid money gets to the most vulnerable.
The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, will give the keynote address at next weeks financing aid conference in Addis Ababa.
Labors foreign affiars spokeswoman, Tanya Plibersek , will be attending, while the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, was yet to confirm either way.
There are a number of foreign policy and security matters that the minister must attend to next week and she is currently finalising her schedule, a spokeswoman said.

The millennium development goals have driven the most successful anti-poverty movement in history , the UN said in its final report before the targets expire. While the MDGs have ended extreme poverty for more than a billion people since they began in 2000, UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon warned that inequalities persist and progress has been uneven.
The EU must plan 25 years ahead in its strategy for dealing with surging numbers of refugees and migrants , warned Franois Crpeau, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants. Crpeau said increasing aid spending to help stabilise turbulent countries would not immediately help stem the flow of migrants and refugees.

Opinion
The sustainable development goals may not mention democracy, but their focus on the accountability of political institutions will be key to improved governance , argues Anthony Smith, chief executive of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy .
Multimedia
On the piece, Democracy is not a mystifying western plot  it is a universal value , MartinMellish wrote:
I live in China. Its not a democracy, and most people have no particularly strong desire that it should be one. The present system of government is working well for them, the economy is still growing at an extraordinary rate. Peoples lives are better than their parents, and far better than their grandparents. That is what is important to them. Should the economy go South, then I imagine there might be a revived interest in democracy, but that would be as a means to an end (prosperity) rather than as a goal in itself.
So - no, democracy is not a universal value, and it is highly dangerous to treat it as such. Trying to impose democracy on people who have no desire for it leads to chaos, bloodshed, and racial and ethnic strife, as many recent examples (Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan, Libya) unfortunately prove.

1 Cash
Greeks cannot withdraw more than 60  about 43  a day from cash machines. Cash is running out, with shortages of 5, 10 and 20 notes and 1 coins. Queues at cash machines are long.
2 Credit cards
Technically, cards are still accepted but many retailers only want cash; some offer discounts for cash. Greeks travelling abroad say they are having problems using cards issued by Greek banks, especially for big bills.
3 Money transfers
Transfers of money outside the country are banned without approval from a special committee, restricting imports and payments to exporters.
4 iPhone apps
People with iPhones report a block on downloading apps. Others who have subscription accounts to pay for iCloud storage received error messages when monthly direct debit fees were due.

5 PayPal
Greeks can receive Paypal payments but cannot spend. The company said capital controls meant funding of PayPal wallets from Greek bank accounts was currently not available.
6 Buy online
The ability to order goods and book services from websites that are based outside Greece  including Amazon.com or airlines such as easyJet  has become limited.
7 Buy or sell shares
The Athens stock exchange has been closed for seven days. It is scheduled to reopen on Thursday  but that prospect seems unlikely unless the banks are also able to resume trading.
8 Pay the rent
Restrictions on cash are making rent and bill payments difficult. Direct debit payments are apparently slowing and e-banking is creaking.
9 Shortages looming
Greek shoppers have been stocking up on staple items  such as coffee, pulses, rice, batteries and soap. Eggs and meat are also becoming more difficult to obtain, according to reports.
10 Pharmaceuticals
Almost all Greek drug supplies are imported and shortages of some essential drugs are reported. Greece owes international drug companies more than 1.1bn, according to an industry body.

Could Greece emulate Argentina's success after it defaulted in 2001?
After Argentina ended the pesos peg to the dollar, its economy collapsed. Yet five years on it was booming. Could that crisis provide a role model for Greece?

An economy in freefall. A run on the banks. Curbs on the amount of money that could be withdrawn from accounts. A team from the International Monetary Fund called back to Washington.
Greece in July 2015? No, this was Argentina in late 2001, when the currency peg between the peso and the dollar was coming under extreme pressure, and capital was leaving the country at an alarming rate.
Like Greece, Argentina was in a currency arrangement that was causing it extreme pain. Like Greece , Argentina had a stark choice: impose fresh budget cuts in the hope of remaining a hard currency; or cutting loose from the peg with a devaluation and debt default.
The parallels between Argentina and Greece are not exact; Argentina was never part of a single currency with the US. What it had was one-for-one convertibility so that the dollar and the peso were interchangeable. Argentina continued to issue its own currency, but used the peg to import anti-inflationary discipline from the US. When monetary policy was tightened in the US, it tightened in Argentina as well. When the dollar strengthened, so did the peso. By the end of the 1990s, Argentina had conquered inflation, but at the expense of driving the economy deep into recession and deep into debt.
Argentina under convertibility was a dry run for Greece in the single currency. Investor confidence rose as a result of the dollar peg and money came flooding into the country, prompting a lending boom. When the mood soured, money started to leave the country  at first in dribbles, but eventually in a flood. To stem the flows, restrictions were introduced that meant Argentines were only allowed to take 250 pesos (then 175) a week out of their accounts. Within six weeks, Argentina had announced a debt default and the end of convertibility.

The short-term impact on the economy was to turn recession into a slump. Argentinas national output collapsed by almost 11% in 2002 and unemployment rose sharply. Annual per capita income fell from $8,500 in the late 1990s to $2,800 in 2002, in large part due to the fall in the peso. The pain was, though, relatively short-lived and growth in the five years after the devaluation was stronger than in the five years that preceded it. Household incomes rose by 43% in five years.
Argentinas adjustment was aided by five factors. First, it already had its own currency and thus avoided the disruption that Greece would face if it returned to the drachma.
Second, it had commodity exports that were in high demand during an upswing dominated by Chinas arrival as a global economic superpower. For Greece, the outlook is not as good. World trade is growing more slowly than it was in the early 2000s, and the Greek economy is dominated by tourism and shipping.
Third, Argentina had been forced to keep interest rates high in order to maintain the dollar peg. When convertibility was abandoned, borrowing costs no longer had to be kept so high and came down sharply. Interest rates in the eurozone are currently at 0.05%.
Fourth, Argentinas deep recession meant it could expand rapidly for a number of years without running into inflationary difficulties. This meant it reaped the benefits of devaluation in its international competitiveness. Greece, too, has ample spare capacity. Its economy has contracted by a quarter and unemployment is 25%.
Finally, devaluation allowed Argentina to write off a chunk of its debts, which fell from 125% of GDP to 72% of GDP by 2005. Again, this would be an option for Greece were it to leave the eurozone.
Those who think Greece would be better off outside the single currency say Athens should heed the experience of Argentina, even though Latin Americas second-biggest economy has subsequently run into serious economic problems, with weak growth and high inflation.
Andrew Kenningham, senior global economist at Capital Economics , said: While no two economies are the same, there are clear parallels between Greece today and the economies that fared best after currency crises. Greece is suffering from a high level of spare capacity, tight credit conditions and a heavy public sector debt burden denominated in a currency against which it may not devalue.
This suggests that, once the dust settles, Greece would be well placed to see a sharp rebound in confidence and a period of rapid GDP growth if it left the eurozone. This would not, of course, solve Greeces economic problems forever, as Argentinas and Russias experiences also amply demonstrate. But it would lead to a brighter outlook than struggling on within the monetary union.

Bill Cosby scandal is the latest chapter in quaaludes' controversial history
Originally developed as an anti-malarial, the drug gained an exclusive cachet for enthusiasts after production ended in the 1980s but also has more nefarious uses

What are quaaludes, exactly? The drug, referred to in pop culture everywhere from Watchmen to The Wolf of Wall Street, is particularly rare  and thus particularly desired by some. Now its back in the news for one of the worst reasons imaginable: Bill Cosby has admitted giving it to a woman he wanted to sleep with.
Related: Bill Cosby: court documents open window into legal problems
Quaaludes werent always this infamous. When The Wolf of Wall Street came out, it featured an almost 15-minute-long sequence in which Leonardo DiCaprios character, the real-life stock market swindler Jordan Belfort, collapses into incoherence and nearly watches his best friend choke to death, all under the influence of several celebratory Lemmon 714 quaaludes. On the drug, the film, set in the late 80s seemed to say, you dont make any sense, but youre having the best time.
Angela Serratore wrote in the Paris Review last year that everyone who talked to her about enjoying the film included a half-whispered, wide-eyed aside: What exactly are quaaludes, and where can we get some?
Methaqualone was first synthesized in India in 1955 by scientists trying to find a cure for malaria. The drug was ineffective against the disease, but not as a central nervous system depressant  and if a user could resist its sedative effects, a user could get high.
Its makers were distressed to hear this: just before it was banned, Lemmon, the manufacturer of the drug that used the name Quaalude in the early 1980s, spent a lot of manpower writing letters to editors demanding corrections when they referred to illegally manufactured methaqualone by their brand name.
Lemmon lawyer Elliot Fisher told the AP in 1981 that the company knew about the illegal market for the drug, but didnt mind. [W]e considered it an excellent sleeping pill and it still is today, he said. Ultimately, the FDA disagreed. (Fisher was probably even less happy with the other slang name for quaaludes: lemons.)
The drug is expensive to manufacture and thus is effectively out of print since it was moved to the Controlled Substances Acts schedule I, alongside heroin and cocaine, in 1984. Lemmon had already stopped making them the previous year because of all the lousy press. Part of quaaludes appeal for its users is simple snobbery  theyre hard to get, and using them makes you part of an exclusive club.
But the drug also has a history of being used on the unwilling that predates the accusations against Cosby. Long before Rohypnol hit the market, quaaludes were a predators drug of choice, in part because its effect intensifies with alcohol. In 1977, when Roman Polanski was convicted of having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl, the victim testified that he used champagne and part of a quaalude to keep her from resisting.
Like any drug thats expired, decades-old quaaludes can lose their potency or develop a delay, but that doesnt stop people from trying them, even recently. On recreational drug boards, there are stories of people trying the substance and congratulatory messages from fellow enthusiasts when they come up. The stories are sometimes anticlimactic, however.
Welll completely backed [sic] out on those Ludes last night, dont know how I got home,but I woke up fully clothed with a quarter oz of weed I dont know how I got, all over my chest wrote one user called Jman6181 on drug forum BlueLight . I got paper wrist bands from bars so I now I went out...wtf.

        <title>Tsipras and Merkel: polar opposites who depend entirely on each other</title>

They are a study in contrasts, the yin and the yang of Europes epic battle for mastery of its destiny. But Angela Merkel and Alexis Tsipras are now almost umbilically linked  the political fate of the one hinging on the policy choices of the other.
Related: Greek debt crisis: Emergency summit begins - live updates
Going into yet another emergency Brussels summit of EU leaders on Tuesday evening, the German chancellor and the Greek prime minister were the main protagonists in a meeting called to decide whether Greece stays in the euro.
The leaders wanted to hear what Tsipras wanted and how Merkel would respond. Buoyed by his victorious gamble in Sundays Greek referendum, Tsipras was under intense pressure to make up his mind and deliver an offer with prospects. Stunned by the boldness of the referendum call and defeated by its outcome, Merkel was under strong domestic pressure not to give further ground.
The space between them and whether it can be bridged is the main factor determining whether Greece is pulled back from the brink of isolation, financial collapse and social implosion, or whether Europe faces one of its biggest collective failures by casting Greece out of the euro.
The Greek and the German are locked in a battle of wills and nerves in which the stakes could not be higher, both for their countries and their own careers.
Merkel created Tsipras. Were it not for five years of wrenching German-scripted austerity in Greece, the leftist radical could not have dreamed of becoming prime minister in January.
But if she made his political career, he now has a big say in settling her political legacy. Whether Merkel goes down in history as the German chancellor who presided over the breakup of the euro by allowing its irreversibility to be shown to be a sham also depends on Athens.
The leaders could hardly be more different. It has fallen to Merkel to save Europe. Tsipras wants to change Europe. It is a fundamental clash of conservatism versus radicalism. Locked in a form of mutual dependency, both can succeed only in relative terms.
Tsipras is of the far left and has been engaged in firebrand politics since his teenage days. Merkel is of the centre right and shunned politics almost entirely until the Berlin Wall fell, opening up opportunities for a shy, middle-aged scientist living in East Germany .
He is a gambler. She is risk averse. He professes to be a visionary and a missionary. She eschews grand schemes, preferring the virtues of modesty, patience, and self-deprecation. For Tsipras, the end seems to justify the means. For Merkel, the means are the main thing: it is seldom clear what her end might be.
Tsipras is criticised as a populist, even a demagogue. Merkel has an acute nose for public opinion and popular sentiment, but could never be accused of ranting.
What they have in common is a tendency towards pragmatism, the ruthlessness common in national leaders and degrees of inscrutability which make it difficult to gauge where they will bend and where they will refuse to compromise.
In 10 years in office that have become synonymous with the euro crisis and made the German chancellor the single most indispensable leader in Europe, Merkel has seen off five Greek prime ministers. In less than six months in office, Tsipras has, in certain ways, proved to be the most formidable of the six she has faced.
When George Papandreou concluded bailout negotiations with the eurozone in 2011 by calling a referendum, Merkel co-plotted his downfall. He went and there was no plebiscite. When Antonis Samaras pleaded with her for help last year on many of the same austerity measures Tsipras is resisting, she spurned him, kept up the pressure and told him to get lost. Samaras then authored his own political crisis and lost office, too. This week, following Tsiprass referendum win, Samaras resigned as leader of the centre right.

But through five months of negotiations with Merkel and the others in the eurozone, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, Tsipras has redefined the art of political brinkmanship. He has yet to blink, even if that means ruin for his country.
Ten days ago, in Brussels, he met Merkel privately, gave no clue of his intentions, attended yet another summit and then returned home. At midnight, out of the blue, he set alarm bells ringing across Europe by calling the referendum.
But Merkel, too, is perfectly capable of pulling a fast one with chilling single-mindedness. These climactic weeks that are so important to both leaders started late on a Monday evening five weeks ago.
On 1 June, Merkel suddenly summoned a quartet of creditors leaders to a late night mini-summit in her office in Berlin. She told neither her finance minister, Wolfgang Schuble, or Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the eurozone finance ministers committee. Instead, the quartet joining Merkel  the French president, Francois Hollande, Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, Mario Draghi, the president of the ECB, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European commission  decided to force a finale on the Greek crisis by producing a five-page aide-memoire dictating the austerity measures Tsipras would need to accept if he wanted to keep being funded by the eurozone.
It was an ultimatum from Merkel to Tsipras. Everything in the past five weeks flowed from that meeting in the Berlin chancellery. The final outcome was being plotted in Brussels on Tuesday night, with Tsipras proposing and Merkel determining the course of events.
They have never needed one another so much.

        <title>Colony, state or independence: Puerto Rico's status anxiety adds to debt crisis</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/07/puerto-rico-statehood-sovereign-rights-debt-crisis</Link>

The word colony conjures images of conquistadors and pilgrims, slavery and imperialism. But in Puerto Rico the supposed anachronism slips into daily conversations about the unstable present and an uncertain future.
Since the April day in 1899 when Americans formally took over the island, Puerto Ricans have felt uneasy about their status within the United States.
Related: Puerto Rico's 'unpayable' debt: is this the Greece of the western hemisphere?
And as the island faces a debt crisis that has cratered its economy and sent its leaders to Washington to plead for more sovereign powers, the issue has taken on a new urgency.
Unique among US territories, Puerto Rico has a state-like government but is not a state: it draws all its authorities from Washington DC and is restricted in ways states are not. The islands ports can only do business with US ships, for instance, and the territory depends heavily on federal aid.
Most pressingly, however, the island lacks authority to either file for bankruptcy or restructure its $72bn municipal debt.
Governor Alejandro Garca Padilla argues that in its current form the debt is unpayable and that greater austerity will exacerbate already difficult living conditions . Padilla has stopped short of endorsing statehood, instead trying to focus on limited new powers.
But other politicians have been bolder. In April, Republican presidential frontrunner Jeb Bush endorsed statehood for Puerto Rico , the homeland of tens of thousands of recent migrants to Florida, the former governors home state.
Puerto Rican citizens ought to have the right to determine whether they want to be a state, he said. I think statehood is the best path, personally. To get the full benefits and responsibilities of citizenship, being a state is the only way to make that happen.
Proponents of statehood argue that its a simple matter of fairness. The islands Democratic delegate in Congress, Pedro Pierluisi , introduced a bill in February that could make Puerto Rico a state by 2021 should a majority of Puerto Ricans vote for statehood  as 61% did in a non-binding referendum in 2012.
One of the top fundraisers for Barack Obamas presidential campaigns, Andrs Lpez, has argued that the status quo is not only unequal but unsustainable.

But the issue has found virtually no traction in Congress, and even appeals over bankruptcy powers have divided the House.
Many Puerto Ricans are skeptical of statehood, saying formal inclusion in the union would do almost nothing to ameliorate pressing issues of unemployment, healthcare and housing.
Antonio Cuarro, a shop owner in Ro Piedras, said the debate amounted to empty rhetoric. Each government just uses one side or the other to get elected, he said. Its all the same.
San Juan legislator Luis Gallardo agreed, saying the campaign exists only in the imagination of our statehood politicians. A lot of people have tried to piggyback on the issue.
Gallardo said he was ambivalent: I dont know whats worse, not having federal bankruptcy powers or having federal income taxes on top of the highest local taxes in the country.
Others balked at becoming the 51st state. Attorney Manuel Rodriguez said statehood could help Puerto Ricans with access to the justice system, bankruptcy options and federal intervention, but its no magic solution and would not necessarily mean progress. Theres also no chance it will happen, given Congress.
Statehood is wrong for Puerto Rico because Puerto Rico is a nation. We consider ourselves Puerto Ricans, not Americans
Senator Ramn Nieves
A minority tapped into long-simmering nationalism and suggested more drastic changes  not quite the violent separatism of the 1960s and 70s, but a crusade for greater independence nonetheless.
Statehood is wrong for Puerto Rico because Puerto Rico is a nation, said senator Ramn Nieves. We consider ourselves Puerto Ricans, not Americans.
What Puerto Rico needs is more powers in its relationship with the US, and eventually a new relationship with the US.
Nieves said Puerto Rico should follow the model of the Marshall Islands, which entered into a compact association with the US in order to retain some rights but also to move toward sovereign nationhood.
We value our history and relationship with the US  thousands of Puerto Ricans have died in foreign wars for a century  but the traditional options of statehood or independence dont help us right now, he said.
Washington has done close to nothing to help, Nieves said, suggesting exemptions from trade restrictions, or guarantees on some bonds: The Treasury always says it will provide technical assistance but that doesnt mean anything.
I dont mean that they should hand us a check for $72bn, but if they cannot be a little more active or willing to help us, they should give us the tools to help ourselves.
Sovereignty is not the same as independence, Nieves concluded. All independent nations are sovereign, but not all sovereign nations are independent.
In casual conversation many Puerto Ricans refer to the territory as a country, and occasionally as a colony. Monuments to Spanish and Latin American history and culture dominate San Juan: Miguel de Cervantes, Juan Ponce de Len and Simon Bolvar all stand tall in the city. References to the US are rarer: a statue of Abraham Lincoln in the old city, the outposts of federal agencies and tourists.
The relationship with the US has aggravated our problems, said Ataveyra Hernndez, a former adviser to the governor. Puerto Ricans are hugely dependent on the government, which depends on federal money. Its a structural problem, and theres an urgent need to renegotiate the relationship.
The Caribbean is full of countries that are small just like us, and they control their own destinies, their resources, their policies.
The Caribbean is full of countries just like us, and they control their own destinies, their resources, their policies
Ataveyra Hernandez
But with constant movement to and from the mainland, the close ties of families, and a continuing military presence on the island, emotional ties to the US remain strong for Puerto Ricans born on both shores. Both flags dot homes in San Juan.
Some view the question of independence more dispassionately. A metro employee at the Ro Piedras stop simply waved her hand toward the desolate plaza nearby.
Look at where we are, she said. Were not ready for that, no way.
In practical terms, Puerto Ricans already enjoy most of the same perks as other Americans, including US passports and billions in welfare from the federal government, though their semi-autonomous government is restricted by and depends heavily on the US. They cannot vote for president and lack a congressional representative who can vote outside of House committees.
But new arrivals to the US who change their residency will be able to vote in the 2016 presidential election, and they could potentially sway key states such as Florida.

In an arty cinema at the end of the 60s I watched Costa-Gavrass stylish political thriller Z which satirised the brutal military regime then ruling Greece . When the film ended the audience enthusiastically applauded, something I had never previously seen in a cinema, and have rarely seen since.
As Europes acknowledged home of political philosophy and practice, Greece of the hated military dictatorship had a special place in the hearts of many Europeans, as it did for Lord Byron when he went off to fight (and die) for Greek independence in 1824. This weekends Solidarity with Greece demonstrations, in small villages as well as major cities, shows it still does.
In its showdown with creditors, the Greek government of Alexis Tsipras exploits this romantic attachment. And why not? Small countries have to use the assets at their disposal in a big world.
But sentiment alone is rarely an adequate guide to action, is it? The Greeks have a case against the counter-productive and excessive severity imposed on them by their creditors. But the creditors also have a case against the Greeks.
Foreigners did not make their government fiddle the entry qualifications to join the eurozone, rack up debts or force citizens to evade their taxes, unless you count the legacy of the rackety Ottoman empire which ruled Greece from 1453 to 1821.
But the very concept of Greece has always been both powerful and fragile, its existence more usually sustained by foreign or domestic tyranny than by sophisticated philosophies from the 4th and 5th centuries BC. Disunity and rebellion have also been characteristic features of Greek politics and identity.
After defeating successive invasions launched by the mighty Persian empire at Marathon (490BC), at Thermopylae (sort of), at Salamis, Plataea and Mycale, did not the Greek city states soon succumb to civil war which ended in Athenss defeat by militaristic Sparta? Yes.
And so it went on. Domination by Macedonia meant that the spread of Greek culture across the Mediterranean  previously led by the soft power of trade and settlement  was expanded east and south by the conquests of Alexander the Great (356BC to 323BC). The Romans later conquered, but deferred (though captured, Greece took its wild conqueror capture, wrote Horace the poet) to the Greeks, much as the Americans did towards Britain for a while. We are the Greeks to their Romans, the future PM, Harold Macmillan, once told a colleague.
In the western Roman empire Rome duly fell (476AD) to barbarian invasions. The eastern half, though battered, morphed into the Christian Byzantine empire which staggered on, a Greek entity, for 1,000 years before Constantinople finally fell to the Muslim Ottomans after the great siege of 1453.
Does any of this matter to the bean counters in Brussels or Berlin this summer? It should.
So should the bean borrowers of Athens acknowledge that German fear of excessive debt and a debauched currency is rooted in troubled German history, the Weimar Republic which led to the Nazi coup, and the fragility of a national identity ravaged by the brutal thirty years war (1618-48).
When Greece restored national sovereignty and unity in 1832, Germany was still 40 years away from doing the same.
If Greeks see themselves as victims, so do Germans, who have picked up the bill to rescue East Germany well within living memory and widely resented it (but they were at least fellow Germans).
This is psychologically risky territory as Angela Merkel and her advisers decide what Germany  and the EU  must do to rescue Greece from its own brinkmanship and save Europe from its lackadaisical management of the crisis.
Germans picked up the bill to rescue East Germany and widely resented it (but they were at least fellow Germans)
But rebellion comes more naturally to Greeks than to Germans who have often traded liberty for security, not always wisely, but understandable with fluid frontiers which an island people like us should gratefully acknowledge.
In the Ottoman centuries the Greeks had an instinct to side with the Caliphs enemies, rising in revolt many times and usually being hammered for their pains. The fact that Venetian Corfu remained free and prosperous and that Crete held out until 1670 (the long siege was a fashionable cause for years) only fed an appetite for defiance which broke into open, ultimately successful revolt in 1821. Cue Lord Byron.
Two further points are worth registering here.
Greeces successive 19th- and 20th-century wars to regain its historic territory, usually involving neighbouring Turkey (as the Ottoman successor state became after defeat in the first world war), were bloody, traumatic affairs. We hear a lot about the Turkish Armenian massacres (were they genocide?), less about the one million Greeks living abroad (resident for centuries) who may have died during waves of displacement and expulsion from Asia Minor. In invading Turkey in 1919, Greece was a part-author of its own misfortune: it lost.
None of this is good for people. Greece had rival governments, once pro-German, once pro-British, during the first world war and remained divided during the inter-war years. Greeks fought like tigers against the invading Italians in 1940 who had to be rescued by the Germans. Even Hitler acknowledged the courage of the Greek resistance which continued long after defeat.
Related: A brief history of German-Greek relations
But the German occupation was savage, both to Greeks and their economy. Many starved. Worse, the European peace of 1945 was followed by the Greek civil war of 1946 to 1949 in which Britain and the US backed the Greek government and the Greek communists were backed by Titos government in next-door Yugoslavia.
Stalin had agreed to leave Greece in the western sphere of influences in his percentages agreement with Churchill at the Kremlin in 1944. He just forgot to tell the Greek comrades. After yet another savage war, they lost, Greece joined Nato  much as it did the EU in 1981 after the Greek colonels were ousted when again the Turks invaded Cyprus (1974)  and Greek democracy was restored.
So the divided legacy of modern Greece remains and is vivid well within living memory  royalist and republican, left and right, urban and rural. The Syriza coalition, led by Tsipras, represents the defeated side in the civil war as Tsipras, a youthful communist of bourgeois stock, explicitly acknowledged in gestures made when he became prime minister in January.
Geographical determinists, the people who argue we are primarily shaped by our environment, might argue that a country with Europes longest coastline  more than 8,000 miles and 2,000 islands (mostly unpopulated)  is bound to be fractious.
In one of his Outliers essays, Malcolm Gladwell, made the point differently when he argued that herdsmen who tend sheep and goats on marginal land  in Greece, Sicily, Ireland or Tennessee  have to have short fuses or their neighbours will steal their animals. Hence the importance of the blood feud which persists. Arable farmers dont have them, its harder to steal wheat.
Be that as it may, Tsipras has his new mandate to negotiate with Brussels and Berlin on an emphatic 60% no vote from a deeply divided nation. Its not hard to see how things could get nasty quickly. And remember, those Germans feel hard done by and put upon too.

        <title>Bill Cosby: court documents open window into legal problems</title>

The release of documents on Monday from a civil lawsuit against Bill Cosby in 2005 offers the first glimpse inside the comics protracted legal problems involving allegations of sexual assaults raised over many years.
The case, brought by a former head of womens basketball at Temple University in Philadelphia, Cosbys alma mater, is the only legal proceeding relating to sexual assault allegations against Cosby that has ever been brought to conclusion, despite numerous accusations that have been brought against him by multiple women. Andrea Constand claimed that she had been drugged and molested by Cosby at his home in January 2005, but following a private settlement in the case, all documents relating to it were sealed, casting the whole matter under a deep layer of secrecy.

Constand herself has never spoken directly about the case since the settlement was reached in 2006.
Now, with the opening of the files following a federal court case brought by the Associated Press, a window has been opened into Cosbys behaviour under his own admission. It marks the first time that the actor has been heard, in his own words, directly referring to purchasing drugs for use in a sexual context.
The court documents include transcripts of the deposition of Cosby on 27 and 28 September 2005. In the course of the depositions, the comic was asked several questions about his purchasing of drugs, leading to tense exchanges between his lawyer Patrick OConnor and a lawyer for Constand, Dolores Troiani.
During the deposition, Cosby said that he had obtained seven prescriptions for the sedative quaalude.
You gave them to other people? he was asked.
Yes, he replied.
When Troiani tried to elicit from Cosby whether he had given the drug to other people knowing that to be illegal, OConnor intervened, instructing his client not to answer.
When you got the quaaludes, was it in your mind that you were going to use these quaaludes for young women you wanted to have sex with? asked Troiani.
Yes, replied Cosby.
Asked whether he had given young women the drug without their knowledge, the lawyer again intervened, advising him not to answer.
Cosby told the deposition that he got the quaaludes prescriptions in the 1970s and then kept them for several years.
The documents also include details of questions Cosby was asked under deposition about another woman, one of the so-called Jane Does who were called anonymously to give evidence in the Constand case. The woman told lawyers that at the age of 19 she met with Cosby and had sex with him after he gave her quaaludes.
In his deposition, Cosby said he met the witness in Las Vegas: She meets me backstage. I give her quaaludes. We then have sex. Cosby then goes on to say: I cant judge at this time what she knows about herself for 19 years, a passive personality.
Cosby adds that the witness was sweet in her personality. As far as I was concerned was well-mannered, didnt demand or give a feeling that she was above anyone. If anything, I think she may very well have been very happy to be around the showbusiness surroundings.
Starstruck? he was asked.
Youll have to ask her, Cosby replied.
The public opening of the documents comes at the end of a tough legal struggle for the Associated Press. On 17 June, lawyers representing the news agency delivered a motion to the federal courthouse for the eastern district of Pennsylvania requesting that they be included as an interested party for the unsealing of the court documents, including Cosbys testimony.
Cosbys lawyers argued that the unsealing of the documents would be terribly embarrassing for their client, the AP reported in June. But, on Monday, their request was granted by judge Eduardo Robreno.
Explaining his decision to release the papers, Robreno is scathing about Cosbys claim that he had a right to privacy. He said that Cosby had donned the mantle of public moralist and mounted the proverbial electronic or print soap box to volunteer his views on, among other things, childrearing, family life, education, and crime. To the extent that Defendant has freely entered the public square and thrust himself into the vortex of th[ese] public issues he has voluntarily narrowed the zone of privacy that he is entitled to claim.
Robreno said the public had a significant interest in the stark contrast between Bill Cosby, the public moralist and Bill Cosby, the subject of serious allegations concerning improper (and perhaps criminal) conduct.
The judge concludes: The nature of the allegations  sex, drugs, seduction, etc  do not cloak this case, including the depositions of one of the parties, with an automatic, or per se, seal of silence.
Since the allegations of sexual misconduct resurfaced last year, the comic has faced renewed legal actions against him. But so far all of them have floundered on the rock of time  the statute of limitations that restricts the period after an alleged crime in which prosecutions can be brought.

        <title>China and Russia: the world's new superpower axis?</title>

Forget euro summits and G7 gatherings: for the countries that like to style themselves as the worlds rising powers, the real summitry takes place this week in central Russia, where Vladimir Putin will hold court.
Leaders of the Brics countries (Brazil, India, China and South Africa) will meet Putin in Ufa on Wednesday, then make way for the Asian powers grouped in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
Russia and China are the common denominators, as in so much geopolitics these days. The UN security council, Apec, the G20 - Russia and China are the ever-presents, a powerful pairing whose interests coincide more often than not.
Moscow and Beijing have lots in common apart from a 2,500-mile border, economies dominated by state-run firms and oligarchies that can enrich themselves as long as they play by the prevailing political mood of the day.
organisation membership
Officially, Putin is dismissive about suggestions of a new eastern alliance. We are not creating a military alliance with China, he said last month. We are not creating a bloc-based approach, we are trying to create a global approach.
And yet both countries share a desire to limit American power; they enjoy a burgeoning trade relationship in which, in essence, hydrocarbons are swapped for cheap consumer goods; and they have a mutual interest in promoting an alternative model to western diplomacy.
Trade has increased sixfold over the past decade. Last year they trumpeted the biggest gas deal in history. The summer will be bookended by two striking events: Russian and Chinese warships puttering about together in the eastern Mediterranean in May, gaming war; and Russian and Chinese presidents standing shoulder to shoulder in Beijing for the 70th anniversary of the end of the second world war in September.
So how robust is the Russia-China axis?
Geopolitics
For China, one of the main attractions of closer relations with Russia is the potential for challenging Washingtons still dominant global position.
In China, where until recently the official line was non-alignment, some prominent scholars have started to make unambiguous calls for a comprehensive strategic alliance with Russia, Alexander Korolev, at the National University of Singapores centre on Asia and globalisation, argued recently . [They are] arguing on the pages of the CCP [Communist party] central party schools internal publications that China-Russia strategic relations are the most substantive ones and elsewhere that China will be unable to shift the world from unipolarity to bipolarity unless it forms a formal alliance with Russia.
But often cooperation and tension are two sides of the same coin. Take Central Asia. Chinas president, Xi Jinping , has set his sights on a new silk road, using Chinas billions to help neighbours and regional allies to develop, indirectly supporting growth at home and the expansion of Chinese soft power.
However, this is also Russias traditional sphere of influence and any Chinese presence that goes beyond commercial dealings is likely to raise hackles in Moscow.
Its totally possible for China to develop its relations with central Asian countries without challenging Russia, said Liu Jun, a Russian studies expert at East China Normal University. Its true that Russia would be concerned if Chinas influence in Central Asia grew too much, but the concerns are not mainstream in the bilateral relations  there are more benefits in cooperation than otherwise.
Russia shares the strategic goal of challenging US hegemony in favour of a more multipolar world, and the two powers often find themselves on the same side in the UN security council, where they wield vetoes as permanent members.

No deal on regulating Irans nuclear programme can be made without Russia and China, which have staunchly backed its atomic expansion in the past, and the two countries support is largely the reason Bashar al-Assad has been able to hold on to power in Syria. Recently, Russia has been making political and economic overtures to North Korea, which relies on food, arms and energy from its key ally, China, to survive.
As they support the idea of a multipolar world against American dominance, Moscow and Beijing will also tacitly back each others attempts to defend their own spheres of influence, said Dmitry Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Centre. In the past two years, Russia has annexed Crimea and backed a separatist campaign to frustrate Ukraines turn to the west, and China has been disputing islands with western allies in the South China Sea.
China admits de facto that Russia has interests in eastern Europe , Russia admits that China has interests around the perimeter of its borders, and even though neither will actively help its partner in Ukraine or the South China Sea, both will observe an advantageous neutrality, Trenin said. There wont be criticism of each other in the areas of their core interests.
Leadership
Government enthusiasm for warmer ties with Russia is summed up by a recent video from the state-controlled Xinhua news agency entitled What Do Chinese People Think About Russia?
It features Chinese children describing Russia as even bigger than China, an old man praising Russias strength, demands for more investment, gas sales, a high-speed train, and plenty of airtime given to adulation of the Russian president.
Putin has long been popular in China, where he is seen as a strong leader who has bolstered national pride, and is not a little admired for his topless photo shoots. Putin youre a handsome man, says one middle-aged woman on being asked what message she would like to send to Moscow.
There is also an overt comparison to Xi, who has fostered a personality cult of bold leadership that has echoes of the Russian leaders (though with less bare flesh). Putin is the same as our Papa Xi, says one young man, using a government endorsed affectionate term for the president.
For their part, Russians are more ambivalent about Xi, who has a far lower profile in Russia than does his counterpart in China.
Trade
Chinas interest in Russian exports has until now been largely focused on natural resources and military hardware. Beyond that they do not make natural partners. Russia can offer little by way of famous brands or innovation in consumer technology to tempt ordinary Chinese customers.
Its a good thing that there is political will behind the business cooperation. Without it, a lot of things wont happen, Liu said. Most big projects are backed by the governments and the volume of trade along the border is quite small.
The imbalance of the relationship can be seen in the breakdown of their bilateral trade, worth around $100bn a year. China is Russias second largest trading partner after the EU, while Russia only just scraped into a list of Chinas top 10 trading partners, accounting for barely 3% of the countrys total trade volume.
Moscow is also hoping Beijing will help with finance for businesses, after western funds dried up last year. Some Chinese firms have seen the Russian economic wobble as an opportunity to make capital investments in the country.
Energy
China and Russia should make natural partners in energy deals, but in reality they have struggled to turn past agreements into real supply deals; pipelines announced last decade have still not been built because of disagreements over pricing and other conditions.
Earlier this year, Russia overtook Saudi Arabia as the largest supplier of oil to China for the first time, with Russian exports to China more than doubling since 2010. But Beijing is accustomed to shopping around for energy and driving a very cheap bargain with its suppliers, while Russia is used to controlling prices for European customers with few other options.
The expansion of shale gas production may have weakened Russias hand by improving global supply, but China is also increasingly concerned about climate change and needs to wean itself off the dirty coal that still provides well over half its energy.
Since Russia has rarely agreed to sell stakes in strategic land-based deposits to western companies, Putins offer of a stake in state oil champion Rosnefts biggest production asset, the Vankor oilfields, to China in September underlined the new direction the countrys energy policy is taking.

The offer was made at a ceremony to start construction of Russias $55bn Power of Siberia pipeline, a breakthrough project that is planned to deliver an annual 38bn cubic metres of gas to eastern China over the next 30 years. In November, the two countries also signed a framework agreement for an Altai gas pipeline to potentially supply 30bn cubic metres of gas to western China each year for 30 years.
But neither pipeline deal appears to have been completely finalised, and economic sanctions and a weak rouble will probably make financing the huge projects difficult for Russias Gazprom.
It seems like at every meeting theres some sort of document signed and hailed as another big agreement  but Gazprom will need to develop large fields and construct the pipelines, said Grigory Birg, an analyst at Investcafe. I think in the current environment securing the finances is the major holdup, and we dont have any indication as to the economics of the project.
Although Birg estimated the rate of return on the Power of Siberia investment to be a modest 9% to 10% when the deal was signed, the profitability is likely to be even less if global oil prices remain weak. Beijing will, by all appearances, be able to drive an even harder bargain for the gas price under the proposed Altai pipeline to western China, a region that has less demand than the industrialised east of the country and already receives cheap gas from nearby Turkmenistan.
Nonetheless, analysts expect energy cooperation to continue to grow as Russia seeks alternatives to the politically thorny European market, and China addresses growing demand and problems with pollution and blackouts. Last year, China replaced Germany as Russias biggest buyer of crude oil. China is the major alternative market and is easily accessible for Russia given the [location of energy] reserves and the geopolitical partnership, so its an obvious fit, Birg said. But the timing at which it is happening is not in favour of Russia.
Pipeline to china
Currency
Both Russia and China have an interest in loosening the US dollars dominance in global trade as the worlds reserve currency. Russia now accepts yuan for oil payments (something that other oil exporters, such as Saudi Arabia, dont do).
Following the imposition of sanctions, Russian companies and banks  traditionally reliant on dollar-denominated syndicated loans  started to look to China for a financial escape route. The rouble-yuan currency pair reached records in trading volumes last summer.
Russian companies are not new to the renminbi market, nor to the issuing of dim sum bonds  bonds denominated in Chinese yuan and largely issued by entities based in China or Hong Kong. In the past these options represented a cheaper source of funding. Now theyre a necessity. However, yields on Russian corporate bonds denominated in yuan have increased as the list of sanctions started mounting up.
Military
Russian arms sales to China have been estimated at $1bn a year, the Russians were previously hesitant to give advanced weaponry to the Soviet Unions one-time military rival. But the recent announcement by Russias state arms exporter of a deal to supply China with its S-400 surface-to-air missile systems has taken their relationship to a new level at a time when Beijing is seeking new air and naval defence technologies.
The higher-level arms sales have been accompanied by greater military cooperation, which was on display in May with the war games in the Mediterranean Sea. Such exercises in what has traditionally been a Nato pond are designed to expand the Chinese navys reach while showing the United States that Russia is a potentially important military partner, according to Trenin.
Following the Ukraine crisis, which soured relations with the west, he said the main considerations behind Russias entente with China were political. Now Russia has an important stimulus to grow relations with China, because relations with the west are troubled, and China is the only large player in the world that can be considered as economic, political and to a certain extent military ally, Trenin said.
China and Russia have repeatedly stated that they will become partners, not allies
Both sides, meanwhile, are concerned that the unrest in Pakistan and Afghanistan could spill over into their territory, or serve as incubators for militants who may one day return home.
But none of that means that either side has forgotten past disputes or present differences. Russia is nervous about China sapping its revenue by reverse engineering the equipment it buys, and is also monitoring Beijing closely for any attempts to project military power into central Asia.
China and Russias strategic partnership is a result of the times, but it is totally different from a military alliance such as the one between the US and Japan, the Global Times, a Chinese nationalist tabloid, said in a recent editorial.
China and Russia have repeatedly stated that they will become partners, not allies. They do mean that. China also cares about relations with western countries. Russia does not want to see relations with the west become a deadlock.
UN vetoes
Cyber security
Both Russia and China share a concern over the US domination of the internet. In January, Russia, China and a number of central Asian dictatorships jointly submitted a new proposal for an international code of conduct on information security to the UN general assembly.
In a clause clearly aimed at the US, the document calls for countries not to use information and communications technologies and  networks to interfere in the internal affairs of other states or with the aim of undermining their political, economic and social stability.
At a recent internet security forum in Moscow, officials from both countries called for a new approach to online security.
Its great they [the US] invented the iPhone but when you open your iPhone and see the camera you have to guess whether its photographing you at that moment or not, said Konstantin Malofeyev, a controversial businessman known for his backing for the Russian Orthodox church and the pro-Russian separatist movement in east Ukraine. Russia went into space first and Antarctic first but we dont control those things, they are controlled by international charters. Why should the US control the internet?

Chinese official Chen Xiaohua said: We should join hands to build cyberspace order. Various countries share a consistent vision of enhancing the governance of cyberspace  following the principles of mutual trust and mutual respect.
In the meantime, Beijing and Moscow signed a landmark cyber-security deal recently that could bolster defence against external attack as well as allowing them to share technology for domestic control.
The two countries have poured resources into managing the internet, aiming to curb its potential as a platform for dissent. Beijings great firewall is a powerful and sophisticated filter of the online world, but is still porous enough that most people inside China do not need to bother trying to evade it.
Both countries also field armies of both hackers and paid pro-government commenters, known in China as the 50 cent group, because of how much they are paid for each post. However, experts say their focus on internal controls may have come at the expense of security.
Prioritising political information control over technical cyber defence also damages Chinas own cybersecurity, Jon Lindsay of Harvard Universitys Belfer centre for science and international affairs said in a recent briefing . Lax law enforcement and poor cyber defences leave the country vulnerable to both cyber criminals and foreign spies.
Business mood
Among some business people, there is a fear that the enforced turn to the east will mean Russia selling out from a position of weakness.
The downturn in relations with the west is bad for Russia and bad for the west; the only beneficiary is China, one top Russian businessman said. The number of Chinese delegations coming to Russia has gone up tenfold, and the Chinese will only enter the market when they see the conditions are very beneficial to them.
Russian media have been told to play up links with China and other non-western countries, and companies have felt pressure from the government to look eastwards even if it makes little business sense. But what initially seemed pointless may be starting to bear some fruit.
It started as theatre, but now there are some companies out there really getting stuff done, said Tom Blackwell, CEO of EM, a consultancy firm that has worked with a number of major Russian companies on exploring the Chinese market. Chinese investment funds have very little experience or knowledge about Russia and its a hard sell. But the strategy seems to be to do the big state deals first and assume smaller ones will follow. Slowly, real things are happening.
Russias federal migration service is especially wary of an influx of Chinese migrants across the Russia-China border. It has stated that Chinese could become the largest ethnic group in Russias far east by the 2020s or 2030s; last summer a border official said that 1.5 million Chinese illegally entered the region from January 2013 to June 2014.
